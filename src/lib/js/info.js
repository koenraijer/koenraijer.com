// Old bio's:
// Hi! Welcome to this always-changing and never-finished hobby project. I work in clinical psychiatry as a medical doctor and am doing research at the intersection of psychiatry and data science. This is where I <i>would like</i> to share my thoughts and report back to the world, although, admittedly, most <a href="#recent_posts" class="anchor">posts</a> are short programming tidbits because I can't stop myself from tweaking the website rather than doing proper writing.
// ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Koen â€” a medical doctor at the intersection of psychiatry and data science, based in <s>Maastricht</s> Sittard, the Netherlands. My research concerns the detection of intrusive memories using physiological data and machine learning. This is where I <i>would like</i> to share my thoughts on a non-specific set of topics, although, admittedly, most are short programming tidbits because I can't stop myself from tweaking the website rather than writing posts.
