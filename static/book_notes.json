    "content": "> De zomers waren vol toogdagen en meetings, de lucht trilde van de massakoren, muziekkorpsen en gierende harmoniums en nooit wapperden in dit land zoveel vaandels en banieren. ’s Winters vergaderde men, over teksten, amendementen of resoluties, men las de eigen bladen, men zwoegde op preken en inleidingen, en zo leidde men binnen de eigen zuil een dubbelleven dat het moeizame bestaan van alledag in een ander, hoger licht zette. (page 70)  \n\n> Een halfjaar later, in november 1924, besloot de protestants-christelijke zuil opnieuw het oude te bewaren met behulp van de modernste technieken: als eerste omroep werd de Nederlandsche Christelijke Radio-Vereeniging opgericht. Rond de kerst klonk voor het eerst het gezang Daar ruist langs de wolken door de radio. De andere zuilen volgden met, uiteraard, eigen omroepen: de rode VARA, de katholieke KRO, de algemene AVRO en de vrijzinnig-protestantse VPRO. Daarmee was een bestel geboren dat ‘met predikatiën, toespraken, zang, enz.’ zou voortwoekeren tot het einde van de eeuw. (page 73)\n- nog altijd bestaande restanten vd verzuiling \n\n> de twee belangrijkste volksbewegingen van de jaren twintig en dertig, het fascisme en het nationaal-socialisme, waren in Nederland onbekend. Doordat de Eerste Wereldoorlog aan Nederland voorbij was gegaan, miste ons land, in de woorden van de historicus M.C. Brands, ‘een cruciale wissel van de moderne geschiedenis van ons continent’. En het gevolg daarvan was dat allerlei lijnen van de negentiende eeuw die in 1918 in de rest van Europa rigoureus waren afgebroken – de keizer, het gezag, de zekerheden –, in Nederland ononderbroken konden doorlopen. Dit alles maakte dat de toch al korte twintigste eeuw hier wel heel kort werd. (page 76)  \n\n> Voor protestanten en katholieken was het zonneklaar dat vrouwen op grond van het bijbelse scheppingsverhaal minder waren dan mannen. Want was niet door de vrouw de zonde in de wereld gekomen, toen Eva zich in het paradijs door de slang liet verleiden? Was het niet de vrouw geweest die de door God verboden vrucht had geplukt van de ‘boom der kennis des goeds en des kwaads’? En had God zelf niet het oordeel over de vrouw uitgesproken: ‘Met smart zult gij uw kinderen baren en naar uw man zal uw begeerte uitgaan, en hij zal over u heersen’? (page 85)  \n\n> Zo maakte hij voor het eerst kennis met de keerzijde van zijn beroep, met de opsplitsing tussen mens en functionaris, een verschijnsel dat men later wel zou waarderen als ‘professionalisering’. (page 89)  \n\n> ‘Twee geloven op één kussen, daar ligt de duivel tussen.’ Dan maar geen kussen. (page 90)  \n\n> De dochter van Abraham de Geweldige schreef in De Standaard dat de vrouw die ‘vleeschkleurige kousen’ droeg, met beide benen ‘in het erf van de vijand’ stond. ‘De vleeschkleurige kous bedoelt: het been bloot te doen lijken, en is dus een oneerbare dracht,’ aldus Henriëtte Kuyper. (page 94)  \n\n> ‘Het is vaak moeilijk uit te maken, hoe allerlei bijzonderheden die Genesis 3 ons bericht, moeten worden uitgelegd. Denk maar aan “de boom der kennis des goeds en des kwaads”, de slang en haar spreken...’ (page 95)\n- bizar hpe letterlijk men de bijbel nam tot voor kort \n\n> Onder theologen – we zagen het hiervoor bij de VU-hoogleraar Van Gelderen – bestond al veel langer het idee dat een letterlijke uitleg van de bijbel nooit de bedoeling was geweest. In de visie van sommigen waren het eerder verhalen die, net als bij Homerus, oorspronkelijk dienden tot stichting, opbeuring en zelfs vermaak. En zeker was de bijbel nooit bedoeld als wetenschappelijk verantwoorde geschiedschrijving. In de wereld waaruit de bijbel afkomstig was, kende men het begrip ‘objectiviteit’ zelfs helemaal niet. Zo’n letterlijk-historische uitleg ontnam bovendien het zicht op de diepere betekenissen die in allerlei teksten verborgen lagen, zo was een vrij gangbare redenatie. (page 97)  \n\n> Als ik alles overdenk, vermoed ik dat mijn vader in dit loyaliteitsconflict – want dat was het – intuïtief heeft gekozen voor de pastorale kant van zijn werk in plaats van voor de theologische. Hij zou dat in de loop van zijn leven nog een paar keer doen. In gewoon Nederlands: hij zag zijn taak niet in de eerste plaats als uitlegger van de bijbel, maar als zielenherder. En daar was hij, eerlijk gezegd, ook het beste in.

Van der Lubbes daad was een geschenk uit de hemel voor de nazi-propaganda, wat de lamgeslagen Leidenaar zich vermoedelijk achteraf ook realiseerde. (page 131)  \n\n> ongekuisd door de milde censuur van het geheugen. (page 140)  \n\n> Bij de gereformeerden lag het allemaal nog ingewikkelder. De NSB bestond – althans in de beginfase – uit eenzelfde soort kleine luyden als zijzelf. Het NSB-gedachtegoed was voor hen dan ook in veel opzichten herkenbaar: de hang naar een autoritair leiderschap, het denken in nationalistische termen, de twijfel aan de democratie, het verlangen naar orde en tucht, de sympathie voor het vrome Duitsland van het Lutherlied, de afkeer van het perfide Engeland en het decadente Frankrijk, het latente anti-semitisme, het was allemaal bekend terrein. (page 162)  \n\n> Voor de vluchtelingen die wel werden toegelaten, werd een speciaal kamp gebouwd. Plannen om dat kamp ergens bij Ermelo neer te zetten werden getorpedeerd door de ANWB – die de Veluwe graag in vakantiestemming wilde houden – en door koningin Wilhelmina, die zo’n vluchtelingenkamp, zoals ze schreef, niet graag in de buurt van haar zomerverblijf zag verrijzen.[5] Uiteindelijk werd achter in Drenthe een plaats gevonden, ver van de grote bevolkingscentra, niet ver van de oostgrens: Westerbork. Er waren een paar christelijke hulpcomités, maar de meeste kosten werden betaald door de Nederlandse joodse gemeenschap. De niet-joodse belastingbetaler zou er geen last van hebben. (page 165)  \n\n> pro-joodsch, maar wel erg de moeite waard om te zien’, en zo ging het voort. Het probleem was niet dat in Nederland opeens een fel anti-semitisme oplaaide. Maar er was wel sprake van een gevaarlijke voorfase, die op dat moment vrijwel niemand zag: de aanwezigheid van de joodse bevolkingsgroep, die eeuwenlang door iedereen als een vanzelfsprekendheid was beleefd, werd in de jaren dertig voorwerp van het publieke debat, ook in Nederland. (page 166)  \n\n> Het geloof was als een tweede wereld waarin ze leefden. Het was een tweede wereld die angst aanjoeg, normen oplegde, strafte en disciplineerde – een paar Hollandse auteurs zijn groot geworden met het beschrijven van deze godvrezende hel –, maar dat was het niet alleen. Het geloof vormde ook een wereld die steunde en troostte, en die ongekende middelen gaf om de slagen van het lot te accepteren. (page 168)  \n\n> Maar in de jaren dertig, toen het gereformeerde leven steeds meer verstarde, begon er bij de hervormden een verrassende opleving. Men begon te breken met de gewoonte om het godsbegrip alleen te gebruiken voor eigen projecties en enkel van de mens uit te denken. Het ging in deze nieuwe benadering om spanningsvelden – tussen zonde en genade, tussen geloof en ongeloof, tussen angst en vertrouwen – en daar was meer voor nodig dan enkel theologie. Geloven werd een zaak van luisteren en accepteren, en minder een kwestie van uitleggen en altijd beter weten. (page 173)\n- ook een mooie manier om de ontwikkelingen in de arts patientrelatie te beschrijven \n\n> Lezen en schrijven over deze periode doet sterk denken aan de verhalen van Tsjechov: een kleine bovenlaag die enkel vervuld is van zichzelf, die zoemt van rangen, standen, kwesties en affaires, en die er geen idee van heeft dat alles, maar dan ook alles, binnen een decennium voorbij zal zijn. (page 176)\n- tot aan WO2 \n\n> Ook in Nederland werd Soekarno gezien als een schreeuwlelijk, een agitator en weinig meer. Het is een propagandabeeld van de Nederlandse regering en de Hollandse nationalisten dat zo diep wortel schoot dat brede kringen er tot de dag van vandaag nog zo over denken. Dat de nationalistische beweging een typische emancipatiebeweging was, waar hard geploeterd en gestudeerd werd, is nooit erkend. En dat Soekarno in werkelijkheid, ondanks al zijn fouten, een zeer charismatisch leider, een groot dekolonisator en een buitengewoon gewiekst politicus was – hij maakte bijvoorbeeld al in een vroeg stadium de Amerikanen duidelijk dat hij geen communistische revolutie wilde, en verwierf zo hun steun –, daarvoor is Holland tot in eeuwigheid blind gebleven. (page 182)  \n\n> In werkelijkheid was, in die wereld waar het ‘zo spookte’, Japan al tien jaar lang in opmars. Het land was in 1931 Mantsjoerije binnengevallen, sinds 1937 was het in oorlog met China en sinds 1938 vocht het ook tegen de Sovjet-Unie in Mongolië. (page 189)  \n\n> De Polen waren er veel ernstiger aan toe. Hitler beschouwde hen als een lager ras, ‘meer dieren dan menselijke wezens’. Het westelijke stuk van Polen werd ‘verduitst’, wat inhield dat de Poolse bevolking van hele dorpen en steden werd verdreven en vervangen werd door Duitsers: een etnische zuivering zoals die in Europa sinds eeuwen niet meer vertoond was. De rest van Polen werd een soort Gestapo-land, waar de SS kon doen en laten wat hij wilde. Instellingen voor bejaarden en gehandicapten werden leeggehaald, intellectuelen en priesters werden bij duizenden vermoord, joden werden in getto’s geconcentreerd, tallozen verdwenen in concentratiekampen, anderen zwierven dakloos rond, honderdduizenden gewone burgers kwamen om van honger en gebrek, vele anderen werden vermoord. In totaal zouden tussen de zes en zeven miljoen Polen de oorlog niet overleven: drie miljoen joden, drie à vier miljoen niet-joden. (page 199)  \n\n> Voor een deel had dit te maken met een vrede die geen vrede was. Het vredesverdag van Versailles had in 1919 de Europese machtsbalans zo fundamenteel uit evenwicht gebracht dat een terugslag vroeg of laat onvermijdelijk was. Bovendien waren uit de hel en de chaos van de Eerste Wereldoorlog twee revolutionaire bewegingen voortgekomen, het communisme en het nationaal-socialisme, waarmee de Europeanen op een of andere manier in het reine moesten zien te komen. Daardoor waren de tegenstellingen in de Tweede Wereldoorlog veel meer ideologisch getint. Meer dan in 1914-1918 kon men spreken van een strijd tussen het ‘goede’ en het ‘kwade’. (page 199)  \n\n> ‘Een mens lijdt dikwijls het meest/ Door ’t lijden dat hij vreest,/ Doch dat nooit op zal dagen./ Zo heeft hij meer te dragen/ Dan God te dragen geeft.’ (page 201)  \n\n> Net als Nederland was ook de Indische archipel jarenlang het centrum van een wankele machtsbalans. Aan de ene kant zou Japan nooit een overname van Indië door de Engelsen en de Amerikanen toestaan, omdat het land de rijke Indische hulpbronnen veel te hard nodig had, aan de andere kant zouden de Engelsen en de Amerikanen nooit tolereren dat die hulpbronnen exclusief richting Japan zouden vloeien. De Duitse staatssecetaris van Buitenlandse Zaken, Ernst von Weizsäcker, vergeleek Indië in mei 1940 ‘met het oog van een tyfoon, waar, zoals bekend, een windstilte heerst omdat de met elkaar strijdende windstromen zichzelf daar opheffen’.

(page 235)  \n\n> Hitler de Waanzinnige liet in de zomer van 1940 een unieke kans schieten. Hij deed geen enkele moeite om zijn nieuwe imperium te consolideren tot een ‘nieuwe orde’, hij sloot geen vrede met de door hem bezette landen, hij bedacht geen oplossing voor de door hem nooit gewilde en geplande oorlog met Engeland, hij dacht al helemaal niet aan een oorlog met de Verenigde Staten, hij richtte zich slechts op één ding: de mythe van de Lebensraum die Duitsland nodig had, en die Lebensraum lag in het oosten. Voor de strijd om die levensruimte te verwerven begon hij vanaf diezelfde zomer zijn voorbereidingen te treffen. (page 236)\n- de mythe van lebensraum was eigenlijk het doodsvonnis van het nazirijk \n\n> Zo ontstond er langzamerhand een klein mirakel: juist bij die kleine luyden, die meer dan wie ook een hekel hadden aan de goddeloze bolsjewieken, die in meerderheid niets moesten hebben van pacifisten, Engelsen, moderne kunst, joodse schrijvers en andere zedenbedervende zaken, juist bij deze mannenbroeders die een grote liefde hadden voor orde en gezag, ontstonden al in een vroeg stadium allerlei verzetskernen. De gereformeerden hadden van binnen iets hards, iets principieel onbuigzaams, een kern van ongenadig gelijk, vreselijk als het ging om hartstocht, schoonheid, ontroering, maar je kon er wel bij onderduiken. (page 238)  \n\n> Naarmate de bezetting vorderde, werden ook steeds meer boter, kaas, graan en andere landbouwproducten naar Duitsland weggesleept. Onder de oudere generatie gold jegens Duitsers nog jarenlang de kreet: ‘Breng eerst mijn fiets maar eens terug.’ De twee miljoen gepikte fietsen stonden symbool voor veel meer. Talloze fabrieksinstallaties werden weggevoerd, bij de Hoogovens zelfs hele plaatwalserijen. Bij de PTT werden tweeënzeventig telefooncentrales leeggeroofd. Complete stukken spoorweg werden, met bielzen, spoorstaven, wissels en bovenleiding, naar het oosten verplaatst. Tienduizenden Nederlandse arbeiders werden in Duitsland tewerkgesteld: aanvankelijk alleen de werklozen, later was geen volwassen man meer veilig voor de Duitse razzia’s. Nederland werd op den duur één groot plundergebied. (page 239)  \n\n> een communistische vluchteling hoorde wat er werkelijk gaande was in Duitsland. Hij liet een brochure drukken onder de titel Führung, de doden klagen u aan en werd vervolgens opgepakt door de Haagse politie wegens belediging van een bevriend staatshoofd.

In Denemarken reed koning Christiaan X – althans volgens de legende – op zijn paard door de straten van Kopenhagen met een jodenster op. Voor de Nederlandse joden kwam er vanuit het veilige Londen taal noch teken. (page 244)\n- oorzaken van de holocaust \n\n> een heel pak bonnen in de pantoffels van de oudste broer van haar verloofde, duidelijk afkomstig van een of andere overval. ‘Daarover zei je niets, je deed net of je niets zag.’ Van een vriendin wist ze dat er bij haar thuis joodse onderduikers zaten, maar daarvan liet ze nooit iets merken. ‘Die mensen zijn trouwens verraden, de joden zijn opgepakt en die vader ook. Net als onze fietsenmaker, die zat er ook tot zijn nek in, ook weggevoerd en nooit meer teruggekomen.’ (page 248)  \n\n> Daarbij kwam een tweede aspect: als één bevolkingsgroep vol-strekt allergisch was voor staatsbemoeienis en ingrijpen van hogerhand, dan waren het wel de gereformeerden. Ze hadden niet voor niets de veilige staatskerk verlaten om overal eigen gemeenten te stichten, en datzelfde gold voor de eigen scholen, de eigen kranten en de andere eigen organisaties die ze ten koste van grote offers in het leven hadden geroepen. Het totalitaire nazi-systeem tastte die autonomie al snel op ruwe wijze aan, en ook daarop reageerden ze buitengewoon fel. Bovendien waren de gereformeerden – en hierin leken ze sterk op de communisten – uitstekend georganiseerd, gedisciplineerd en offervaardig. Hun zuil was niet al te groot, ons kende ons, en zo kon het netwerk van predikanten – die altijd een alibi hadden om te reizen – in de Landelijke Organisatie een vitale rol spelen. (page 250)  \n\n> We dienen bij het achteraf beoordelen van dit alles permanent voor ogen te houden dat deze massale, industriële uitroeiing uniek is in het bestaan van de mensheid. Als er in de geschiedenis één voorbeeld is geweest van een ‘credibility-gap’, dan was het wel de holocaust. Voor veel journalisten in die dagen waren de eerste berichten over de vernietigingskampen zo ongeloofwaardig dat ze die beschouwden als wat al te grove oorlogspropaganda. (page 253)  \n\n> Men wist, en tegelijk wilde men niet weten, uit puur lijfsbehoud. (page 253)  \n\n> De Indische Nederlanders konden zich in de kampen het best aanpassen. ‘Wat nemen Indische jongens wat wij ontberingen noemen veel gemakkelijker dan wij,’ schreef een gevangene na een halfjaar kamp. ‘Het is net of ze haast allemaal het rimboeleven gewend zijn; allemaal kunnen ze koken, weten ze wat je eten kunt; ze vinden in het bos wortels, knollen en bladen enzovoorts, die ze koken en tot iets verwerken, in de rivier ontdekken ze dadelijk oesters bij het duiken op de bodem, en die worden de eerste avond al gekookt en opgegeten.’ Juist datgene waarvoor mijn moeder altijd zo bang geweest was, het verindischen van haar kinderen en haar man, werd nu een zaak van levensbelang. (page 262)  \n\n> Bovendien was Hitler ervan overtuigd dat de Russen vroeg of laat Duitsland zouden aanvallen, en hij wilde hun voor zijn. En hij had haast, want sinds de winter van 1937-1938 was hij er op een of andere manier van overtuigd niet lang meer te zullen leven. (page 279)  \n\n> Bij het beeld van Hitler als kwaadaardig genie past het idee dat hij ook de hele oorlog volgens een duivels schema bedacht had en dat plan vervolgens keurig uitvoerde. De uiterlijke orde, discipline en regeldrift van het Derde Rijk waren echter volstrekt misleidend. In werkelijkheid was Hitlers besluitvorming – daar zijn de meeste historici het wel over eens – tamelijk chaotisch en impulsief. Hitler maakte zich als het ware los van het alledaagse bestuur om zo de rol van ieders vaderlijke Führer te kunnen spelen. Binnen de nazi-top heerste dan ook geen ambtelijke of managementcultuur, maar eerder de sfeer van een hofhouding. Dat betekende dat in de wat lagere regionen opvallend veel werd gerommeld en geïmproviseerd. (page 279)  \n\n> In zijn meesterlijke psychologische portret van Hitler maakt de journalist/historicus Sebastian Haffner een vergelijking tussen Hitler en Napoleon, en daarbij springt één verschil direct in het oog: de Franse keizer blijkt, ondanks zijn mislukte veldtochten, onnoemelijk veel te hebben nagelaten: zijn wetgeving, zijn onderwijssysteem en niet in de laatste plaats zijn strakke staatsopbouw met departementen en prefecten. Hitler heeft daarentegen, schrijft Haffner, ‘geen staatsvorm ontworpen en zijn prestaties, die de Duitsers tien jaar lang overdonderden en waarvoor de wereld haar adem inhield, zijn kortstondig en spoorloos gebleven – niet alleen omdat ze in een catastrofe eindigden, maar ook omdat ze nooit op bestendigheid gericht waren’. (page 280)  \n\n> De volgende dag, zondag, werd Amerika de oorlog ingetrokken door de Japanse aanval op Pearl Harbor. De donderdag daarop maakte Duitsland een fout die fataal zou zijn: Ook Hitler verklaarde de Verenigde Staten de oorlog. Hitlers oorlogsverklaring aan Amerika was – ik volg nogmaals Sebastian Haffner – de meest onbegrijpelijke van al zijn beslissingen. Duitsland was Japan helemaal niets verplicht. Duitsland, Italië en Japan hadden alleen afspraken gemaakt voor het geval een van deze zou worden aangevallen, en daar was in dit geval geen sprake van. Als Hitler zich rustig had gehouden, zou de Amerikaans-Japanse oorlog hem zelfs van een boel zorgen hebben bevrijd.[2] Bovendien: wat moest Duitsland, zonder voldoende macht over de zeeën, zonder intercontinentale raketten – want die bestonden nog niet –, met een vijand die het zelfs niet kon bereiken? (page 281)  \n\n> Het waren niet alleen de geallieerde bombardementen die Duitsland te gronde richtten. In die laatste oorlogsmaanden gaf Hitler bevel om ook Duitsland zelf te herscheppen tot dorre aarde, fabrieken te verwoesten en honderdduizenden Duitsers van huis en haard te ‘evacueren’. Deze laatste order, die niets wilde weten van een leven na de oorlog, ging zelfs de meeste nazi-leiders te ver. Ze legden het bevel naast zich neer. (page 283)  \n\n> omhoog, tot het tienvoudige van de voorgaande periode. Volgens naoorlogse schattingen zou, als de internering nog een halfjaar langer geduurd had, vrijwel iedereen boven de vijftig jaar gestorven zijn, en de helft van degenen onder die leeftijd. (page 290)  \n\n> Mijns inziens is de Anti-Revolutionnaire Partij hierin wel sterk-schijnend en gezag-handhavend, maar toch fout.’ Hij vreesde dat de mannenbroeders in Nederland zich weer ‘voor het kapitalistische wagentje van de oud-koloniale politiek’ zouden laten spannen, zoals ze dat onder Colijn altijd al hadden gedaan. En langzamerhand kwam bij hem de vraag op of hij bij het leger – ‘dat wil zeggen: dit klungelleger’ – nog wel langer wilde werken. (page 313)\n- belang van de ARP in Indie na WO2 \n\n> Batavia- (page 314)\n- hoofdstad NL Indie \n\n> Dat gold ook voor de Birmaspoorweg, die tweehonderdduizend mensenlevens kostte en waaraan mijn vader bijna crepeerde. Hoewel het in principe een goede verbinding was, werd ze direct na de oorlog gesloten omdat niemand er belang bij had. Birma zocht het isolement, de Engelsen vonden de lijn een gevaarlijke concurrent voor Singapore en alleen Thailand bleef er een gedeelte van gebruiken: de eerste honderddertig kilometer van Thonburi – een voorstad van Bangkok – tot het plaatsje Nam Tok. Voor de rest heeft de bevolking de lijn nooit als iets van haarzelf beschouwd, het was een raar overblijfsel van de Japanse bezetting en verder niets. Toen ik ruim veertig jaar na de oorlog een poging deed om de voetsporen van mijn vader in Birma en Thailand na te reizen, was het eerste stuk van de dodenlijn inmiddels omgesmeed tot een toeristische attractie. In Bangkok adverteerden de touroperators: ‘Board the original Death Railway Train, for a one hour journey to Nam Tok. Don’t hesitate! Join our Death Railway Tour!’ (page 315)  \n\n> In 1914 was Europa wereldleider, zoals Amerika dat nu is. De macht van de Europese landen werd door niemand betwist, via hun koloniale rijken beheersten ze de wereldhandel en op bijna alle terreinen – economie, techniek, cultuur – liepen ze voorop. In 1945, na dertig jaar zelfvernietiging, was dat allemaal voorbij. De Sovjet-Unie en vooral de Verenigde Staten hadden de hegemonie overgenomen, het vooroorlogse zelfvertrouwen was verdwenen, het prestige was uiteengespat. (page 320)\n- sentiment in na oorlogs europa \n\n> De oude machten in de samenleving bleken, juist in de chaos van de eerste naoorlogse jaren, veel taaier te zijn dan de jongere generatie dacht. Binnen korte tijd hadden ze hun oude organisaties weer op de been, ze kregen de communicatiekanalen in handen, en daarmee hadden ze de Nederlanders opnieuw in het gareel. ‘Noch de vernietigende werking van de oorlog,’ schrijft de historicus Blom in dit verband, ‘noch de onmiskenbaar opgeroepen nationale gevoelens, eenheidsdenkbeelden en vernieuwingswil, noch de radicalisering van delen van de arbeidersbevolking, noch de democratiserende en doorbrekende werking van de oorlogscontacten en gezamenlijk geleden gebrek, noch ook het falen van het systeem in 1940 en van een deel van de leiders in de oorlog, slaagde erin dit systeem te breken.’ (page 323)\n- dit is hoe men ook over de vvd zal spreken \n\n> De eerste groep die de macht van de oude orde weer voelde, was de jeugd. Al snel na de bevrijding ontstond onder de ouderen een regelrechte morele paniek. ‘De jeugd, die al die jaren niets heeft gehad, denkt alleen nog aan dansen en roken,’ schreef tante Ans in haar eerste brief aan mijn moeder. ‘Soms ben je blij dat je geen dochters hebt.’ En inderdaad, wat moest dat met onze zoons, die in de hongerwinter gewend waren geraakt aan ‘stelen, liegen en bedriegen’, met onze dochters, die met onze bevrijders dansten en deden ‘volgens primitief zinnelijke impulsen’. (page 324)\n- veranderende seksuele en niet seksuel moraal door de oorlog \n\n> De naoorlogse geboortegolf, zoals men het later zou noemen, is ook gemáákt. Het is een nog altijd zichtbare herinnering aan een ongekende uitbarsting van seksuele activiteit na de lange oorlogsjaren. Een drift die sterker was dan alle leer en moraal, en die ook stevig werd uitgeleefd, binnen, buiten, voor en achter het huwelijk. (page 325)  \n\n> Zo bleef het land tot in de jaren zestig verzuild en verdeeld, net zoals het voor de oorlog ook was geweest. In politiek en maatschappelijk opzicht betekende de oorlog voor Nederland vooralsnog geen wezenlijke breuk. Het oude leven zette zich gewoon weer voort. (page 325)\n- dus: ontzuiling vanaf jaren 60 \n\n> De katholieken kennen het probleem niet, omdat bij hen de rituelen van doop, biecht en communie een verzekering van genade bieden. Maar bij de protestanten is dat veel minder duidelijk. Je kunt daar over de doop een pessimistische vooronderstelling hebben – ‘De doop zegt nog niets, pas als je “wedergeboren” bent, weet je dat je uitverkoren bent, maar o wee, als je dat niet voelt...’ – of een optimistische – ‘De doop is een bezegeling van de belofte van God dat je “uitverkoren” bent, je hoort daarmee tot zijn “verbond”, en als je in Hem gelooft, komt het wel goed.’ (page 326)\n- dit zou uiteindelijk tot de creatie van de vrijgemaakte gereformeerde kerk leiden, de kerk van de weimas? \n\n> Daarna waren er de talloze drama’s binnenskamers. Vriendschappen werden verbroken, verkeringen raakten uit, middenstanders verloren de helft van hun klantenkring, boeren emigreerden, families werden uiteengescheurd. Zo’n zestigduizend gereformeerden scheidden zich af tot de Vrijgemaakte Gereformeerde Kerken in Nederland. Ze stichtten een eigen zuil, met, opnieuw, een eigen krant (Het Nederlands Dagblad) en een eigen weekblad (De Reformatie), een eigen theologische opleiding en een eigen politieke partij, het Gereformeerd Politiek Verbond.

Het heeft brochures en pamfletten geregend over deze zaak. De Reformatie slaat een taal uit waar we ons over bedroeven moeten. Je ziet, het is geen schisma van geringe omvang.

De regering in Jakarta had, als gebaar van verzoening, de vorstin nadrukkelijk uitgenodigd om met de Indonesiërs de vijftig jaren van onafhankelijkheid te vieren. Maar de Nederlanders vonden dat Indonesië pas in 1949 onafhankelijk was geworden, bij de soevereiniteitsoverdracht, en de koningin kwam pas vier dagen na het feest. Dat was niet alleen een gebaar van ongekende lompheid. Het was meer. Nog altijd wilde Nederland de rebellie niet erkennen. Nog altijd wilde Den Haag niet begrijpen waar het om ging.

Er was nog nauwelijks televisie – de communicatie verliep via massale toogdagen, toespraken en volle zalen –maar veel mensen hadden wel radio. Daarop hoorden ze van alles wat niet paste in het kader van de oude zuilen en dat, zoals het heette, in goede banen geleid moest worden. Bovendien kwam er meer vrije tijd. Net als in de jaren twintig begonnen de kranten te klagen over het lanterfanten, het café- en bioscoopbezoek, het níét naar beschaafde muziek luisteren, en al die andere vormen van ‘onnutte’ vrijetijdsbesteding. Met name de jongeren begonnen de georganiseerde verbanden van de zuilen te verlaten, en hun eigen weg te zoeken. (page 377)  \n\n> nauwe samenwerking met de Israëli’s.

Ze hadden vrijwel alle avonden van hun veertigjarig huwelijk doorgebracht zonder televisie, en toen het toestel er eenmaal stond, beïnvloedde dat hun leven slechts op een beperkte manier. Ze bleven hun avonden meestal lezend doorbrengen, ze gingen naar concerten, ontvingen bezoek, draaiden een grammofoonplaat van Mozart of Debussy. Ze keken alleen naar het Journaal en naar bepaalde programma’s die ze van tevoren hadden uitgezocht. Ze behandelden de televisie eigenlijk als een soort elektronisch huistheater, een schouwburg waar je soms heen ging en soms niet, en dat bleven ze doen. (page 396)\n- zo wil ik het ook! \n\n> Intuïtief raakten de provo’s twee uiterst gevoelige plekken in de Nederlandse samenleving. Aan de ene kant wezen ze er voortdurend op dat de preutse, zuinige moraal van de oudere generatie op geen enkele manier meer paste bij de almaar groeiende welvaart. Maar tegelijk staken ze ook de draak met het toenemende materialisme, met de auto’s, met de roomkloppers, met alles wat ‘de verslaafde consument’ begeerde. Daarmee grepen ze onbedoeld terug op de oude Hollandse onderstromen van soberheid en behoud. (page 403)  \n\n> Toch hadden de marxisten een groot probleem: waar was de oude geest van de arbeidersrevolutie? In Oost-Groningen leefden nog strokartonarbeiders die als gaaf voorbeeld konden dienen van Marx’ onderdrukking van het proletariaat, maar voldoende was dat allerminst. De meeste werkers genoten een ongekende welvaart, zaten tevreden achter hun nieuwe televisietoestellen en hadden geen oren naar welke klassestrijd ook. Een oplossing bood de zeer populaire filosoof Herbert Marcuse. Hij verklaarde de passiviteit uit de ‘repressieve tolerantie’, de verdraagzaamheid van het liberale gezag die in zijn visie niets anders was dan een slimme manier om de massa eronder te houden.

Zo begon de periode die Norman Davies in zijn Europese geschiedschrijving treffend aanduidt met de tijd van het ‘consumentisme’.

In totaal zijn in de afgelopen honderd jaar zo’n 115 miljoen Europeanen door politiek geweld om het leven gekomen: 13,5 miljoen in de Eerste Wereldoorlog, 41,3 miljoen in de Tweede Wereldoorlog, 54 miljoen in de Sovjet-Unie tijdens vervolgingen en hongersnoden tussen 1917 en 1953.[1] Daarbij komen nog eens de vele miljoenen die van huis en haard werden verdreven bij deportaties en etnische zuiveringen. En over de immense materiële schade praat ik niet eens, de verwoeste steden als Warschau, Dresden, Rotterdam, Coventry, Ieper, het culturele erfgoed van vele generaties dat voorgoed verloren ging. (page 432)  \n\n> Het ijzeren gordijn dat Europa na de Tweede Wereldoorlog in twee helften deelde, deed vergeten dat de werkelijke politiekgeografische breuklijn in het continent meer naar het oosten ligt. Het is de lijn die loopt tussen de westelijke christelijke cultuur en de oostelijke, een breuk die zestien eeuwen teruggaat, tot de opsplitsing van het Romeinse imperium in een oostelijk en een westelijk rijk. De grens tussen deze twee stukken Europa loopt ruwweg van Finland, langs Sint-Petersburg en de Oostzeestaten, dwars door Oekraïne, Roemenië, Servië en Bosnië, en eindigt in Montenegro aan de Adriatische Zee. (page 433)\n- zeer fascinerend \n\n> In diezelfde triomfstemming kwam overal ter wereld een nieuw conservatisme tot bloei. In wezen was hier sprake van een soort ontdemocratisering, zowel in macht als in welvaart en ontplooiingsmogelijkheden. Signalen uit de maatschappij, minderheidsstandpunten, ze werden steeds vaker opzij geschoven. In West-Europa werd de betrekkelijke democratie van de nationale parlementen meer en meer uitgehold door de bureaucratie van de Europese Unie. De economische politiek werd steeds vaker gericht op het aanbod van het bedrijfsleven, en niet op de vraag van de mensen zelf. (page 435)  \n\n> De ongekend massale en langdurige welvaart heeft oude levenspatronen op zijn kop gezet. Vergeleken met de kapotgewerkte mannen en de hoestende kinderen in het Zwarte Nazareth van 1899 leven de Nederlanders nu als koningen.

Wat zijn de biologische, psychologische en sociale krachten en zwakten van de patiënt? Welke stressoren hebben het evenwicht tussen draaglast en draagkracht verstoord?\n- Welke problemen moeten aangepakt worden om de veiligheid en/of het evenwicht zodanig te herstellen dat de patiënt de acute dienst kan verlaten?\n- Wat is de DSM-5 classificatie?\nVrij naar Sederer & Rothschild, 1997.\n\n- Als een patient zegt dat “het net is alsof ik afgeluisterd wordt”, is er geen sprake van een waan maar van een waanachtige gedachte. Het realiteitsbesef (de reality testing) is dan niet echt gestoord.\n\nVreemd en excentriek gedrag en een neiging om je af te zonderen doen denken aan een cluster A persoonlijkheidsstoornis. Splitsen, manipuleren, idealiseren en devalueren, een dramatiserende kinderlijk – egocentrische one presentatie, geringe frustratietolerantie, en een gering of sterk wisselend zelfvertrouwen kunnen doen denken aan een cluster B persoonlijkheidsstoornis Overmatig precies, olijk, netjes gedrag of een overmatige afhankelijke angstige opstelling kunnen een aanwijzing zijn voor het bestaan van een cluster C persoonlijkheidsstoornis. \n\nBehandelaars inventariseren en wegen de symptomen en verschijnselen van de patient en noteren de DsM-5-classificaties. Amerikaanse literatuur betitelt deze classificaties vaak als'd diagnose'. Daar dreigt echter een semantische verwarring. Behandelaars classificeren immer niet alleen, maar zoeken ook naar een verklaring in biologische, psychologische en sociale termen. Ze leggen een verband tussen de etiologie en het beloop van de stoornis en stellen zc een diagnose. Vervolgens vertalen zij de diagnose in brede zin naar een individuele zieke. Een psychiatrische diagnose is dus meer dan alleen een DsM-5-classificatie.\n\nGerson en Basuk (1980) hebben in hun review zeven criteria beschreven die de basis zouden moeten vormen van een besluit tot behandeling in de spoedeisende psychiatrie:\n1. de aard en de beschikbaarheid van het steunsysteem;\n2. gevaar;\n3. de voorgeschiedenis en de huidige toestand, inclusief de vroegere coping door de patient met soortgelijke stressoren;\n4. het vermogen om voor zichzelf te zorgen;\n5. de motivatie en geschiktheid om deel te nemen aan een behandelprogramma;\n6. verzoeken van de patiënt en zijn familie;\n7. de somatische toestand.\n\nInterventies:\n- Onderhandelen, rollenspellen, positief heretiketteren, ‘publieke tribunes’ ontruimen (overtallige aanwezigen naar huis sturen), het ‘rampenscenario’ bespreken (voorspellen van het mislopen van afspraken), huiswerkopdrachten geven, en andere paradoxale interventies bedenken (zie daarvoor hoofdstuk 5 Veranderingsgerichte crisisinterventie en hoofdstuk 6 Psychodynamische psychiatrie).",

    "content": "New resampling methods like permutation tests and bootstrapping have various advantages over traditional statistical methods:\n\n1. Fewer assumptions. Resampling methods don’t require normality or large sample sizes.\n    \n2. Greater accuracy. Permutation tests, and some bootstrap methods, are more accurate in practice than classical methods.\n    \n3. Generality. Resampling methods are remarkably similar for various statistics and don’t require specific formulas for each statistic.\n    \n4. Promote understanding. By providing concrete analogies for theoretical concepts.\n    \n## Procedure\n\n1. Resample. Create hundreds of bootstrap samples, i.e. resamples, by *sampling with replacement* from the original random sample.\n    \n    - Each bootstrap sample has the same size as the original sample.\n        \n2. Calculate the bootstrap distribution, which is the distribution of all resample statistics.\n    \n3. Use the bootstrap distribution. It gives information about shape, center and spread of the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n    \n\n**Bootstrap idea**\n\n> The original sample represents the population from which it was drawn. So resamples from this sample represent what we would get if we took many samples from the population. The bootstrap distribution of a statistic, based on many resamples, represents the sampling distribution of the statistic, based on many samples. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=12&annotation=3AKJ9MFJ))\n\nThis fact can be verified in situations where we know the population, and applies to many situations where we do not know the sampling distribution.\n\n**Bootstrap distribution for the mean**\n\n*Shape:* nearly normal, following the CLT.\n\n*Center:* low bias.\n\n*Spread:* use bootstrap standard error.\n\n**Bootstrap standard error**\n\n> The of bootstrap standard error of a statistic is the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution of that statistic. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=13))\n\n$SE_{boot,\\overline{x}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{B - 1}\\sum(\\overline{x}^* - \\frac{1}{B}\\sum{\\overline{x}^*)^2}}$\n\nCalculate the variance of each bootstrap sample using the mean of the bootstrap distribution. Calculate the mean of that and take the square root. *This is just the ordinary standard deviation of the B values of* $\\overline{x}^\\*$.\n\n**Note:** we know that $\\overline{x} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$, where $\\sigma$ is usually replaced by the sample SD $\\hat{\\sigma}$. The bootstrap standard error will agree quite closely with the estimate of the standard error $\\hat{SE} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}$.\n\n## Why does bootstrapping work?\n\nThe bootstrap is not a substitute for gathering more data to improve accuracy.\n\nRather, the bootstrap idea is to use resample means to estimate variance. We use the data twice; to estimate the mean and again to estimate the variation.\n\nThis is very common in statistics, as SE is commonly estimated using sample SD.\n\nThe differences are:\n\n1. Instead of using $\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}$, we use resampling to compute the SE.  \n    \n2. We use the bootstrap distribution to see whether the sampling distribution is approximately Normal, rather than just hoping that our sample is large enough for the central limit theorem to apply.\n    \n\n**Plug-in principle:**\n\n> To estimate a parameter, a quantity that describes the population, use the statistic that is the corresponding quantity for the sample. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=17))\n\nThe bootstrap idea uses the distribution of the data (our sample) to estimate the population distribution, then draws samples to mimic the process of building a sampling distribution.\n\n> The bootstrap allows us to calculate standard errors for statistics for which we don’t have formulas and to check Normality for statistics that theory doesn’t easily handle. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=19&annotation=BU6I7WK6))\n\n### Summary\n\n- Bootstrapping involves resampling with replacement from the original data, calculating the statistic for each resample, and inspecting the bootstrap distribution created.\n    \n- An example of the plug-in principle: the bootstrap distribution approximates the sampling distribution of the statistic.\n    \n- It usually has approximately the same shape and spread as the sampling distribution, but it’s centered at the statistic, whereas the sampling distribution is centered at the population parameter.\n    \n- Bootstrap standard error is the SD of the bootstrap distribution.\n    \n- The bootstrap distribution does not replace or add to original data. It can be used to estimate the variation in a statistic based on the original data.\n    \n\n## 18.3 Bootstrap Distributions and Standard Errors\n\nIf the bootstrap distribution appears to be Normal and centered at the true parameter value, we can use bootstrap SE to calculate t confidence interval.\n\nAn estimator is biased when its sampling distribution is not centered at the true population parameter.\n\nWe can calculate the **bootstrap estimate of bias** with $\\hat{\\mu}_B - \\overline{x}$, as an estimate of the true bias.  \n\n**Bootstrap distributions and sampling distributions:**\n\n> For most statistics, bootstrap distributions approximate the shape, spread, and bias of the actual sampling distribution. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=24))\n\nThey differ in the location of their centers: whereas the sampling distribution is centered at $\\mu$ plus any bias, the bootstrap distribution is centered at $\\overline{x}$ plus any bias. The two centers are different but the two biases are similar.\n\nIf the bootstrap distribution is not normal for the mean, we can consider using another statistic like the median. Another alternative is the 25% **trimmed mean** $\\overline{x}_{25\\%}$, which uses only the middle 50% of observations.\n\nThe median is the mean of the 1 or 2 middle observations. The trimmed mean often does a better job than the median, and bootstrapped medians don’t work very well.\n\n## Bootstrap t confidence interval\n\nThe familiar one-sample t confidence interval for the mean of a Normal population, $\\overline{x} \\pm t\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ , can also be used to find the bootstrap t confidence interval.\n\nSuppose a bootstrap distribution is:\n\n1. Approximately Normal\n    \n2. With small bias\n    \n\nAn approximate level C confidence interval for the **population parameter** that corresponds to this statistic is:\n\n$statistic \\pm\\,t\\times\\,SE_{boot,statistic}$\n\nWith $t$ being the critical value of the $t_{n-1\\,df}$ distribution with area C between -$t$ and +$t$.\n\n**Note:** the t critical value can be found in a table using the correct df and confidence level, or estimated from the data. It can also be calculated in R using `qt()`.\n\n## Bootstrapping to compare two groups\n\nTwo-sample problems are among the most common statistical settings. In it, we compare two populations, based on separate samples from each population.\n\nWhen both populations are roughly Normal, the two-sample t procedures compare the two population means. The bootstrap can also compare two populations, without the Normality condition and without the restriction to comparison of means.\n\n> The most important new idea is that bootstrap resampling must mimic the “separate samples” design that produced the original data. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=28&annotation=67WHSX4F))\n\n### Procedure\n\nGiven independent SRSs of sizes $n$ and $m$ from two populations:\n\n1. Draw a resample of size $n$ from the first sample and a separate resample of size $m$ from the second sample. Compute a statistic that compares the two groups, such as the difference between the two sample means.\n    \n2. Repeat this resampling process hundreds of times.\n    \n3. Construct the bootstrap distribution of the statistic. Inspect its shape, bias and bootstrap SE in the usual way.\n    \n\n### Summary\n\n- Bootstrap distributions mimic the shape, spread and bias of sampling distributions.\n    \n- Bootstrap SE is the SD of the bootstrap distribution.\n    \n- Bootstrap estimate of bias is the bootstrap distribution mean minus the original sample mean. Its bias corresponds to the bias of the sampling distribution to the population distribution.\n    \n- The bootstrap can estimate the sampling distribution, bias and SE of a wide variety of statistics.\n    \n- For bootstrap distributions that are approximately Normal, with small bias, we can give a **bootstrap t confidence interval**, $statistic \\pm t \\times SE$, for the parameter. Don’t use it if the bootstrap distribution is not Normal or shows substantial bias.\n    \n- To use bootstrapping to compare two samples, we draw separate resamples from the two original samples.\n    \n\n## 18.4 How Accurate is a Bootstrap Distribution?\n\n> For example, the margin of error in a confidence interval expresses the uncertainty due to sampling variation. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 38](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=37&annotation=75MHT5XH))\n\n**Sources of variation in a bootstrap distribution:**\n\n1. The original sample is chosen at random from the population.\n    \n2. Bootstrap resamples are chosen at random from the original sample.\n    \n\nWhat we see here:\n\n- The bootstrap distribution is centered around the original sample, whereas the sampling distribution is centered at the population mean.\n    \n- Shape and spread of bootstrap distributions resemble the sampling distribution.\n    \n\n**Reminder:** bootstrap distributions do not have the same center as the sampling distribution; they mimic bias, not the actual center.\n\n## Bootstrapping small samples\n\nWith small sample sizes, bootstrap distributions are more likely to resemble any skewness present in the original sample.\n\nAlmost all the variation in bootstrap distributions comes from the selection of the original sample from the population. You can reduce this variation by using a larger original sample.\n\nBe cautious in any inference from a small sample.\n\n## Bootstrap Confidence Intervals\n\n> We don’t need conditions on the population or special knowledge about the sampling distribution of the statistic. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=44&annotation=DNSQTNWB))\n\nContrary to the t-test, the bootstrap t CI does not require assumptions for the population distribution, but it **does** require assumptions for the bootstrap distribution:\n\n1. Normality\n    \n2. small bias\n    \n\nThe bootstrap percentile confidence interval will correspond  closely with the bootstrap t confidence if the bootstrap distribution meets these assumptions.\n\n### More accurate bootstrap confidence intervals\n\n> We say that a method for obtaining 95% confidence intervals is in a particular setting if 95% of the time it produces intervals that capture the parameter and if the 5% misses are shared equally between high and low misses. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=49&annotation=DTQWR5CU))\n\nConfidence intervals are never exactly accurate because the conditions under which they work are never exactly satisfied in practice.\n\nFor bootstrap t confidence interval, we can we check whether 1) bootstrap distribution is skewed, 2) the bootstrap  percentile CI corresponds with the t  CI.\n\nThe two bootstrap CI’s may not be accurate enough with:\n\n1. too much bias\n    \n2. skewed bootstrap distribution\n    \n3. high accuracy is needed because the stakes are high.\n    \n\n## Significance Testing Using Permutation Tests\n\nGeneral reasoning for hypothesis tests:\n\n1. Choose a statistic that measures the effect we are looking for.\n    \n2. Construct the sampling distribution of the statistic if the effect were **not** present in the population.\n    \n3. Locate the observed statistic on this distribution.\n    \n\nBecause p-values are calculated by assuming the null hypothesis is true, we can’t resample from the observed sample like with bootstrapping.\n\nWe must obey the resampling rule for hypothesis tests: “Resample in a manner that is consistent with the null hypothesis.”\n\nThe mathematical term for “scrambling a group of things” is called permutation.\n\n**Permutation test:** a resampling procedure that scrambles the assignment of values in groups.\n\n**Permutation resample:** a random sample without replacement taken from the joint sample.\n\n**Permutation distribution:** the distribution of the statistic consisting of permutation resamples, under the condition that $H_0$ is true.\n\n**Permutation p-value:**\n\nProportion of resamples with values higher than the observed value.\n\n- $x$ : resamples higher than the statistic$_{obs}$.\n    \n- $P$ : total number of permutation resamples\n    \n- $p = \\frac{x + 1}{P + 1}$\n    \n\nFor the two-sided p-value, we can mirror the observed result (`5` becomes `-5`).\n\nWe add:\n\n- $y$ : resamples lower than the mirrored statistic$_{obs}$.\n    \n- $p = \\frac{x + y + 1}{P + 1}$\n    \n\n### Advantages of permutation tests\n\n- Permutation tests give accurate p-values even if the sampling distribution is not close to normal, t-tests only do so if the sampling dsitribution of the difference in means it at least roughly normal.\n    \n\n> Permutation tests provide a “gold standard” for assessing two-sample tests. If the two -values differ considerably, it usually indicates that the conditions for the two-sample don’t hold for these data. Because permutation tests give accurate -values even when the sampling distribution is skewed, they are often used when accuracy is very important. Here is an example. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=62&annotation=JDRDWZDY))\n\n### When are permutation tests valid\n\nAbout t-test’s robustness:\n\n> The two-sample test starts from the condition that the sampling distribution of is Normal. This is the case if both populations have Normal distributions, and it is approximately true for large samples from nonNormal populations because of the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem helps explain the robustness of the two-sample test ([Hesterberg et al., p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=64&annotation=5LZIP5RY))\n\nThe permutation test removes the Normality condition, but it requires two populations to have identical distributions when the null hypothesis is true - the same means, spreads and shapes. It needs that, because it moves values randomly to construct the sampling distribution under $H_0$, which would not be valid otherwise.\n\nThe permutation test is not robust against different spreads for samples of different sizes; while the Welsh t-test is robust against that. But, usually it is reasonable to assume that distributions are approximately the same under $H_0$.\n\n\n### Sources of variation\n\n- Original sample\n    \n- Resamples\n    \n\nThe more resamples, the less variation:\n\n$\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{B}}$\n\nThus, B can be chosen to obtain a desired level of accuracy.\n\n### General procedure for permutation tests\n\n1. Compute the statistic for the original data\n    \n2. Choose permutation resamples from the data without replacement in a way that is consistent with the test’s $H_0$ and with the study design.\n    \n3. Construct the permutation distribution of the statistic from its values in a large number of resamples.\n    \n4. Find the p-value by locating the original statistic on the permutation distribution.\n    \n\nFormula methods obtain p-values from certain standard distributions that appear when certain conditions are met, by using either tables or software algorithms. The statistic must be standardized to have the required distribution when $H_0$ is true.\n\n### When can we use permutation tests?\n\n- Two-sample problems when $H_0$ is that the two populations are identical.\n    \n- Matched pairs designs when $H_0$ says pairs have only random differences\n    \n- Relationships between two quantitative variables when $H_0$ says the variables are unrelated (correlation is common here).\n    \n\n> Permutation tests can’t be used for testing hypotheses about a single population, comparing populations that differ even under the null hypothesis, or testing general relationships. In these settings, we don’t know how to resample in a way that matches the null hypothesis. ([Hesterberg et al., p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/SDJZI9LX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/YNKGDVQK?page=68&annotation=HSBI4XZI))\n\nIn those situations, we can often calculate a bootstrap confidence interval instead. These are less accurate, but work without assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Permutation tests are significance tests.\n    \n- They are based on permutation resamples, which are drawn without replacement (contrary to bootstrap resamples).\n    \n- Permutation resamples must be drawn in a way consistent with $H_0$:\n    \n    - *Two-sample design:* 2 populations are identical\n        \n    - *Matched pairs design:* no difference between the values (randomly permute within each pair of observations)\n        \n    - *No relationship:* randomly assign values to each of two variables.\n        \n- Permutation tests don’t require Normal population distribution, they apply to a variety of statistics, and they can give very accurate p-values, regardless of shape and size of population.\n    \n- To give a confidence interval along with a p-value, combine bootstrap resampling and permutation resampling.",

Then if experiment 1 can result in any one of m possible outcomes and if, for each outcome of experiment 1, there are n possible outcomes of experiment 2, then together there are mn possible outcomes of the two experiments. ([Ross, 2010, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=17&annotation=AWIV5P74))\n\nProof is the following enumeration / matrix:\n\nE.g. 10 women each have 3 children. 1 woman and one of her children are to be chosen as mother/child of the year. How many choices are possible?\n\n**Generalized basic principle of counting:**\n\n> If r experiments that are to be performed are such that the first one may result in any of n1 possible outcomes; and if, for each of these n1 possible outcomes, there are n2 possible outcomes of the second experiment; and if, for each of the possible outcomes of the first two experiments, there are n3 possible outcomes of the third experiment; and if …, then there is a total of n1 · n2 ···nr possible outcomes of the r experiments. ([Ross, 2010, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=17&annotation=6PHE7DWJ))\n\n- E.g. Pick a subcommittee from a committee of 3 freshmen, 4 sophomores, 5 juniors and 2 seniors, 1 from each class. How many different combinations are possible?\n\n- How many functions defined on $n$ points are possible if each functional value is either 0 or 1?\n\n\t- $2^n$.\n\n- How many license plates would be possible if repetition among letters or numbers were prohibited?\n\n\t- 26 \\* 25 \\* 24 \\* 10 \\* 9 \\* 8 \\* 7 (for 3 letters, 4 numbers)\n\n\n## 1.3 Permutation\n\nHow many different ordered arrrangements of abc are possible? abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba: 6. For the first letter there are 3 positions, for the second letter the remaining 2, and for the 3rd the remaining 1. Thus: 3\\*2\\*1, or 3!.\n\nEach arrangement is known as a permutation.\n\n**Note:** What I get from this, is that you can keep applying the basic rule of counting: that if there are $r$ experiments each resulting in one of $n1$ outcomes, and if for each of those outcomes the next experiment has $n2$ outcomes, the total number of outcomes is $n1 \\* n2\\*.\n\n1. Divide the problem in parts that you can solve using some rule (e.g., permutation).\n\n2. Combine the parts using the basic rule of counting.\n\n\n* * *\n\n10 books total, of which 4 are mathematics, 3 are chemistry, 2 are history and 1 is language. Books on the same subject must be next to each other. How many arrangements are there?\n\nFor the subjects, there are 4, so there are 4! permutations.\n\nFor the books within the subjects, the number of permutations are as follows:\n\nMathematics: 4!\n\nChemistry: 3!\n\nHistory: 2!\n\nLanguage: 1!\n\nCombining this using the counting principle, gives us:\n\n4! \\* 4! \\* 3! \\* 2! \\* 1!\n\n* * *\n\nFor permutation problems where some items are identical, use:\n\n$\\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!n_r!}$\n\nFor example:\n\nfor different combinations of letters in “PEPPER” (3P’s, 2E’s, 1R, 6 total letters)\n\n6! / 3! \\* 2! \\* 1!\n\n## 1.4 Combinations\n\nThe number of different groups of $r$ items that could be formed from a set of $n$ items.\n\nI.e. how many groups of 3 can be selected from 5 items A, B, C, D, and E?\n\n$\\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$\n\n> From a group of 5 women and 7 men, how many different committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men can be formed? What if 2 of the men are feuding and refuse to serve on the committee together? ([Ross, 2010, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=21&annotation=WAI3TZML))\n\nThis can be split up in 2 parts:\n\n- How many groups of 2 women can be formed from 5 total?\n\n\t- n = 5, r = 2\n\n\t- 5! / 3!2!\n\n- How many groups of 3 men can be formed from 7 total?\n\n\t- n = 7, r = 3\n\n\t- 7! / 4!3!\n\n- Combining this gives us: $35 \\times 10 = 350$.\n\n- What if 2 men are feuding?\n\n\t- 3 groups of 7 men can be written as $\\binom{7}{3} $, which can be split up as the number of groups with 2 men forming a group of 2, and the other 5 forming the other person in the group: $\\binom{2}{2}\\binom{5}{1}=5$\n\n\t- $\\binom{7}{3} = 35-5=30$ options left.\n\n\t- For the women, it’s still $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ options.\n\n\t- From the counting principle: $10 \\times 30 = 300$\n\n\nIf you have a problem of the previous format, you can split it up.\n\n* * *\n\nDon’t understand 4c yet.\n\n# Chapter 2\n\n## 2.2 Sample Space and Events\n\nSample space = set of all possible outcomes of an experiment, $S$.\n\n- For probability of sex of a newborn: $S = \\{g, b\\}$.\n\n\nAny subset $E$ of the sample space is known as an **event**, ie., an event is a set consisting of possible outcomes of the experiment.\n\nFor any 2 events E and F of a sample space S:\n\n$E \\cup F$ means that either E or F occurs.\n\n- If $E = \\{g\\}$ and $F = \\{b\\}$, then $E \\cup F = \\{g, b\\}$.\n\n- $E\\cup F$ is the whole sample space $S$.\n\n\n$EF$ or $E \\cap F$ is the intersection of E and F; it’s the probability that both E and F occur.\n\nThe null event is denoted $\\varnothing$, it signifies an empty set. If $EF = \\varnothing$, then E and F are *mutually exclusive.*\n\nWe can define multiple unions (OR) or intersections (AND) as:\n\n$\\cup_{n=1}^{\\infty}E_n$\n\nFor an event E, we define a new event $E^c$, which  refers to the *complement* of E, i.e., all outcomes in $S$ that are not in E.\n\nIf all outcomes in E are also in F, then E is *contained* in F, i.e., E is a *subset* of E:\n\n$E \\subset F$, or $F \\supset E$.\n\nIf $E \\subset F$ and $E \\supset F$, then $E = F$.\n\nExamples of rules from algebra that also apply here:\n\n## 2.3 Axioms of Probability\n\nFor an event E from sample space S, $n(E)$ is the number of occurrences of E in $n$ repetitions of the experiment.\n\nWe can then define the probability of E as:\n\n$P(E) = \\lim\\limits_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{n(E)}{n}$\n\nBut, modern probability theory does not rely on this limiting frequency, and defines P(E) as follows:\n\n## 2.4 Some Simple Propositions\n\n$P(E^c) = 1 - P(E)$\n\n- I.e., the probability a chance does not occur is 1 - the probability that it does occur.\n\n\nIf $E \\subset F$, then $P(E) \\leq P(F)$.\n\n- For example, the probability of rolling a 1 with a die, is less than or equal to the probability of rolling an odd value with the die.  \n\n\n$P(E \\cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(EF)$\n\n**Example:**\n\n> J is taking two books along on her holiday vacation. With probability .5, she will like the first book; with probability .4, she will like the second book; and with probability .3, she will like both books. What is the probability that she likes neither book?

([Ross, 2010, p. 34](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=49&annotation=JRWWVMYF))\n\n*Method 1:*\n\nIf we regard the order as relevant, total number of outcomes is\n\n11 \\* 10 \\* 9 = 990\n\nTo grab 3 balls, 1 white, 2 black, the number of outcomes with WBB is 6 \\* 5 \\* 4 = 120.\n\nWe could also get BWB: 5 \\* 6 \\* 4 = 120, and BBW: 5\\*4\\*6 = 120.\n\nThus, a total of 360 outcomes are possible with 1 white and 2 black balls.\n\nP(E) = 360 / 990 = 4/11\n\n*Method 2:*\n\nIf we disregard the order, we can find the number of ways to get 3 balls from a total of 11 as $\\binom{11}{3}$. The number ways to draw 1 white ball from a total of 6 white balls is $\\binom{6}{1}$. Lastly, the number of ways to draw 2 black balls from a total of 5 black balls is $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n\nPlugging this into the formula gives us:\n\n$P(E) = \\frac{\\binom{6}{1}\\binom{5}{2}}{\\binom{11}{3}}=\\frac{4}{11}$\n\n* * *\n\n> For instance, suppose 5 people are to be randomly selected from a group of 20 individuals consisting of 10 married couples, and we want to determine P(N), the probability that the 5 chosen are all unrelated. ([Ross, 2010, p. 35](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=50&annotation=HGT4X5PX))\n\nTotal number of possibilities: $\\binom{20}{5}$.\n\nTo determine the possibilities of choosing 5 unrelated people, we must first pick 5 of 10 different couples: $\\binom{10}{5}$. Next, we pick one of 2 from each of 5 couples: $2^5$.\n\nSo, the total number of possibilities is $\\binom{10}{5}2^5$.\n\nCombined, we get: $\\frac{\\binom{10}{5}2^5}{\\binom{20}{5}}$\n\n* * *\n\n> An urn contains n balls, one of which is special. If k of these balls are withdrawn one at a time, with each selection being equally likely to be any of the balls that remain at the time, what is the probability that the special ball is chosen?

The other balls in the group must be chosen from the remaining balls: $\\binom{n-1}{k-1}$.\n\nWith 4 balls and a group of 2, this gets us:\n\n$\\frac{\\binom{1}{1} \\binom{3}{1}}{\\binom{4}{2}}$\n\n* * *\n\n> A poker hand consists of 5 cards. If the cards have distinct consecutive values and are not all of the same suit, we say that the hand is a straight. For instance, a hand consisting of the five of spades, six of spades, seven of spades, eight of spades, and nine of hearts is a straight. What is the probability that one is dealt a straight? ([Ross, 2010, p. 36](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=51&annotation=IWI2V7IV))\n\nWith 5 cards dealt and 52 cards a pack, all combinations of 5 cards are: $\\binom{52}{5}$.\n\nFor the probability of getting a straight, we must look at the probability of getting: [A, 2, 3, 4, 5]. There are 4 of each, and as such, the probability is $4^5$. Of those possibilities, 4 are so-called straight flush (all of the same suit), so the possibility of getting [A, 2, 3, 4, 5] not from the same suit is $4^5 - 4$.\n\nThere are multiple ways of getting a straight:\n\n[A, 2, 3, 4, 5], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] etc. Up until [10, B, V K, A] $\\to$ for a total of 10 ways.\n\nSo the total amount of ways you can get a straight is $10(4^5 -4)$.\n\nEverything together gives us: $\\frac{10(4^5-4)}{\\binom{52}{5}}\\approx.0039$\n\n* * *\n\n> A 5-card poker hand is said to be a full house if it consists of 3 cards of the same denomination and 2 other cards of the same denomination (of course, different from the first denomination). Thus, one kind of full house is three of a kind plus a pair. What is the probability that one is dealt a full house? ([Ross, 2010, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/I5U4DG78)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3ZCA69IL?page=52&annotation=LS3I6IRG))\n\nTo get the same card three times, the probability is $\\binom{4}{3}$. There are 13 cards from which we could have this happen.\n\nTo get another card 2 times, the probability is $\\binom{4}{2}$. There are 12 cards from which this can happen (-1 from the previous 3).    \n\nCombined, this gives us $\\frac{\\binom{4}{3}13 \\binom{4}{2}12}{\\binom{52}{5}}$\n\n**Stopped at example 5J.**\n\n* * *\n\n## 4.1 Random Variables\n\n**Reminder:** when determining the number of options for something with $k$ equal outcomes, repeated $n$ times, do $k^n$.\n\n> Three balls are to be randomly selected without replacement from an urn containing 20 balls numbered 1 through 20.

If X represents the number of successes that occur in the n trials, then X is said to be a binomial random variable with parameters (n, p). Thus, a Bernoulli random variable is just a binomial random variable with parameters (1, p).

Quite job-focused, career-focused. Health equals functioning well at work. \n- Homosexual tendencies are still viewed as pathological. \n- Implicit value judgements guide health. Such as being in favor of withdrawal in Vietnam. \n- Rigid idea on health\n- The writing is just as stiff. This becomes apparent only while reading Alan Poe’s letter in the last chapter. I yearned for more of his lively, spirited tone. \n- It’s a book that is about morality as much as it is about adaptation without being self-aware about it, which feels awkward. \n## Quotes\nProjection causes paranoia. It is a defense of the truly desperate. Projection warrants lying. \nProjection is a type of externalisation. \n\n> We should not be surprised that a chronic user of a specific immature defense can often understand another user with similar problems.\n> Perhaps the reason that both adolescents and adults with character disorders can find love and comfort through peer self-help groups is that such groups can forgive, see through, and confront the immature defenses common to the group.\n> The average human is not so gifted; we often condemn and thereby enhance the impregnability of immature defenses.\n\np. 84\n\n  \n> Indeed, among those who seek out psychotherapy, neurotic defenses are often more prominent than immature mechanisms, not because the need for intervention is greater but because these relatively more adaptive mechanisms are more likely to cause conscious discomfort than the less adaptive immature mechanisms.\n\np. 84\n\n  \n> **In evaluating the significance of a given defense, both context and flexibility become exceedingly important.\n> If a defense is used in a rigid, inflexible way, if it is motivated more by past needs than by present and future reality, if it too severely distorts the present situation, if it abolishes rather than limits gratification, or if it dams rather than rechannels the expression of feelings, then it is likely to be maladaptive.**\np. 85\n\n> Displacement, which separates emotion from its object, and intellectualization, which separates emotion from ideas, can lead to arid lives unless they evolve into sublimation; for sublimation permits idea, object, and attenuated emotion to remain together in overt behavior.\np. 97\n\n  \n> Anticipation is undoubtedly a mechanism that is enhanced by\npsychoanalysis and long-term psychotherapy; and, to a limited\nextent, anticipation means the capacity consciously to tolerate feelings that other ego mechanisms would keep from view.\np. 116\n\n  \n> **Those who used suppression most had the least need for the other defenses in this book; but their lives hurt.**\np. 121\nNote: The price of suppression\n\n  \n> (In contrast, the implicit permission of the psychiatric interview led men who characteristically used little suppression especially physicians to rush on and discuss the painful areas of their lives with candor that was sometimes cathartic and sometimes confessional.)\np. 124\nNote: People that don’t use suppression confess readily given the opportunity. \n\n  \n> If repression banished the idea from consciousness while preserving the affect, Freud showed that isolation spared the idea and banished the feeling.\nIn Freud's words, \"The ego succeeds in turning this powerful idea into a weak one, in robbing it of the affect — the excitation with which it is loaded,... the idea, now weakened, is left in consciousness, separated from all association.\" Such is the nature of obsessions. They go around and\naround in our mind, but they seem so unimportant.\np. 132\nNote: Repression is the feeling without being able to remember the reason for it (I do this). Isolation is the idea without the feeling (I do this, too). \n\n  \n> Of all the defense mechanisms, intellectualization under\nwhich I have included the psychoanalytic terms isolation, undoing, and rationalization) was most clearly associated with a specific character type: the obsessive-compulsive personality.\np. 132\n\n  \n> Since the beginning of history, ritual has been a device to separate ideas from terrifying feelings; and, like many otherwise rational men, Penny showed reliance on ritual.\n\nAt twenty-five, he had severe attacks of asthma.\n\nHe found that he could avert them\nby using a specific brand of inhaler.\n\nLater, he discovered that simply carrying the inhaler with hinı at all times was amulet enough to keep the asthma at bay.\n\nPenny said of his wife, \"We have found that we can't maintain a disagreement when we say our prayers together at the end of the day.\n\nThis is one ritual we promised each other to maintain.\"\n\nHis marriage has prospered for thirty years.\np. 134\n\n  \n> **Displacement is the major mechanism underlying a wide variety of human behavior. Phobias and hysterical conversion symptoms, wit, caricature, and parody, games and hobbies all reflect affect displaced from one object to another. Unlike the other neurotic defenses, displacement permits instinctual discharge. In this way it resembles the mature defenses that channel conflictual impulses which most neurotic defenses block. Granted, the border between displacement and sublimation or that between wit and humor is difficult to mark with any kind of\nprecision.**\np. 139\n\n  \n> Reaction formation reflects an inflexible attitude, affect, or behavior that exactly opposes an unacceptable impulse.\np. 145\nNote: Overdekking door het tegendeel. De overdekking is rigide. Bijvoorbeeld: ik moet áltijd sterk zijn voor de ander. \n\n  \n> Unwittingly, people who use reaction formation convey an abrasive superiority.\np. 147\n\n  \n> By its very reversal of the subject's needs, the defense can stand in the way of subsequent rescue.\n\n(Reaction formation)\np. 149\nNote: (Reaction formation)\n\n  \n> **To summarize this chapter, isolation leaves the idea in consciousness, stripped of all affect.\n\n(\"I think of killing him, but I feel\nno anger.\")\n\nIn contrast, repression leaves the affect in consciousness, but so stripped of conscious ideation that even the object remains obscure.\n\n(\"I feel angry today, but I cannot think at\nwhom.\")\n\nDisplacement allows the subject's conflict-inducing idea and affect to remain linked but directed toward a less dangerous object.\n\n(\"Today, after lunch with him, I got very angry at my dog.\")\n\nReaction formation allows the subject to keep in consciousness an idea and affect that are quite opposite to those\nin his unconscious.\n\n(\"It's my Christian duty to love him.\")\n\nDissociation permits the ego to so alter the subject's internal state that the pain of conflict becomes irrelevant.\n\n(\"Every time I see him, we get drunk and laugh over old times.' .\")**\np. 156\n\n  \n> With all neurotic defenses, what is important is that they alter the interior of the user.\n\nOutsiders are spared involvement in the\nuser's backbreaking task.\n\nUnless specifically told, outsiders may\nnever learn of the user's painful phobias and obsessions.\n\nUnlike mature and immature mechanisms, which often become en\ntwined with moral or social judgment, neurotic mechanisms are regarded as individualistic quirks.\n\nNevertheless, patients do not\ngo to physicians or shamans because they are paranoid or altruis\ntic.\n\nRather, it is largely the neurotic mechanisms that allow the\nuser to present himself to others in the sick role.\n\nPerhaps this social response has been facilitated by mankind's discovery that\nin the setting of the consulting room, \"healers\" may interpret neurotic defenses and provide helpful insight.\np. 156\n\n  \n> **The user of neurotic defenses is a self-diagnosed sinner who gratefully confesses and thereby wins absolution.\n\nIn marked contrast, the user of immature defenses either rushes from priests to throw stones at the cathedral door, or he views himself as the only righteous man in the world, a seer unjustly persecuted by fools.**\np. 157\n\n  \n> Put another way, throughout our lives we populate our inner\nworld with people.\n\nIf, thanks to a benign childhood, our inner\nworlds come to include constant people, toward whom we have\nrelatively unambivalent feelings, then in real life our relation\nships will remain relatively assured, loving, autonomous, and\nwell-demarcated.\np. 160\n\n  \n> When baited by their adolescent children, even the most reasonable and staid parents become hopelessly involved and utterly unreasonable.\n\nYet, the process by which this all happens is obscure; and even if noticed, it seems quite mysierious to an outsider.\np. 161\n\n  \n> **There is something curious, almost eerie, about projection.\n\nParanoia, jealousy, severe prejudice, and demonic possession all result in obsessive overinvolvement with the enemy.\n\nIf projection produces a fear that those close to you may harm you, it also\npromises a special kind of intimacy with strangers.\n\nFor example, to be on somebody's \"Most Wanted\" list; and if loved by no one else, neglected spinsters are desired by the imaginary lechers who lurk beneath their beds. In short, projection is neither a defect nor a definite sign of insanity; it is merely one of the more extraordinary ways in which humans comtort themselves.**\np. 162\n\n  \n> First, acting out involves giving in to impulses in order to avoid the conscious tension that might result with any postponement of expression.\n\nSecond, acting out translates impulse into action so fast that the user escapes feeling or thinking about what he does.\n\nThird, acting out permits the user to express an unconscious impulse directly while ignoring internalized taboos that forbid the act.\np. 175\nNote: Acting out\n\n  \n> Not only is there a link between projection and acting out in dangerous criminals, but in more adaptive form these two defenses are also fused within the revolutionary.\n\nIn the 196os it was never clear to our state department whether Fidel Castro was a political visionary or an outlaw with a chip on his shoulder.\n\nLike the humblest delinquent from the ghetto, the revolutionary has often been victimized as a child.\n\nViolence begets violence, and perhaps the only creative use of violence is in revolution.\np. 177\n\n  \n> Consider how little help others offer those driven to acting out, for although society tries to respond to overt depression with solicitousness, in many states suicide, the ultimate acting out, is kept on the statutes as a felony.\np. 179\n\n  \n> Second, rather than altering his mind with alcohol and sleeping pills, Hood discovered he could use transcendental meditation to dissociate himself from anxiety.\n\nHis current plan is to give up working entirely, and live with his wife off a recent inheritance, while meditating in the Virgin Islands.\n\nThird, at forty-five, Robert Hood became a master of reaction formation.\n\nHe had achieved sobriety, a stable if asexual marriage, and a job; he had given up friends, children, alcohol, and sexual intercourse.\n\nThe price he paid illustrated Freud's quip that a young whore makes an old nun.\np. 179\n\n  \n> Unlike many of the neurotic defenses, the defense of hypochon\ndriasis can never be breached by suggesting \"It's all in your\nmind.\"\n\nIn response, hypochondriacs will only amplify their pain.\n\nHypochondriasis is a plea that attention must be paid.\n\nLike the\nAncient Mariner, the hypochondriac seems driven to let others\nknow the most excruciating details of his agony.\n\nHe is relieved\nonly when the observer acknowledges that the hypochondriac's pain is the worst since the world began; and so like other immature defenses, hypochondriasis binds others to the user.\n\nOften this is achieved by evoking guilt in the caretaker, and always someone else ends up taking responsibility for the hypochondriac's anger.\n\nWe get so angry at his complaints that we become oblivious to his covert rage; we believe it to be our own.\np. 180\nNote: Hypochondriasis / somatisation\n\n  \n> In some ways, the distinction between hypochondriasis and\ndisplacement is semantic, for both mechanisms provide symbolic\nways of expressing abstract feelings.\np. 182\nNote: Hypochondriasis is displacement onto the own body. \n\n  \n> Angry feelings give us a pain in the neck.\n\nSexual feelings make\nus hot and bothered.\n\nAnxiety makes us choke up.\n\nGrief puts a\nlump in our throat and a pain in our heart.\n\nWe tremble and grow\ncold with fear.\n\nIn displacement, however, the symptom serves as\na synonym, a means of communication, a conversion of affect into\nits somatic equivalent.\n\nFear does reduce blood flow to our skin,\nand anxiety does result in a sense of breathlessness.\n\nIn hypochondriasis, however, the physical complaint is exaggerated and takes on a life of its own.\np. 182\n\n  \n> Since it outwardly disavows her anger, the martyrdom of the inwardly enraged housewife makes her family miserable; there is no way for them to combat the rage that she denies.\np. 185\nNote: (Masochism / passive-aggressive behavior)\n\n  \n> Probably because sadism and\nmasochism are irrevocably intertwined.\n\nFor example, the long\nsuffering child, to punish his parents, may run away from home\nwith inadequate clothing.\n\nThe rejected lover may cut her wrists\nbecause her boy friend cannot stand the sight of blood.\np. 186\n\n  \n> It does no good to punish a teenage son for failing to wear his rubbers; the pain of punishment is never enough to cancel the rewarding assurance that his mother still cares.\np. 186\n\n  \n> Some people have divided humanity up into the \"guilties\" and the \"paranoids,\" into those who blame themselves and those who project blame.\np. 187\n\n  \n> With maturation, passive aggression is often given up in favor of displacement, reaction formation, and altruism.\np. 187\n\n  \n> Passive-aggressive behavior is closely linked to an adaptive process which Anna Freud called identification with the aggressor.\n\nThrough such identification, an individual, who hitherto has felt safe only by prostrating himselt before a potential aggressor, now achieves mastery by incorporating or identifying with the\nvery traits in the aggressor that he used to fear.\np. 188\nNote: Prostrate = to lie face down as an act of submission\n\n  \n> When he did not clean up his room,\nhe was locked in it until it was picked up.\n\nAt age eight, despite years of lock-ups, the battle over a clean room continued.\n\nTom went on strike and refused to touch the mess at all.\n\nHis mother persisted in jailing him; surreptitiously, Sawyer retaliated by\nhiding more and more mess under his bed.\n\nFinally, the battle with his mother over discipline became so severe and the lock\nups so repetitive, that Tom like many a famous passive resister\nbefore him — won.\np. 188\n\n  \n> Clearly, it must be studied prospectively.\n\nIt is all too common for caterpillars to become butterflies and then to maintain that in their youth they had been little butterflies.\n\nMaturation makes liars of us all.\np. 198\n\n  \n> Now we know that the romantic swain at five will at seven regard the opposite sex with loathing, only to become a romantic swain once more at age sixteen.\np. 200\nNote: Child development\n\n  \n> The evidence from the Grant Study confirms the adult life patterns outlined by Erik Erikson in Childhood and Society.\n\nErikson suggested that in a variety of cultures the grammar school child, having already passed through stages of Basic Trust, Autonomy, and Initiative, develops Industry while keeping his adventurous passions under control.\n\nThen, in adolescence, as his suppressed passions return, the child strives for an Identity an effort to differentiate himself and his beliefs from his parents.\n\nNext, as a young adult, he seeks genuine Intimacy with people his own age, and then, finally, somewhere around forty according to Erikson, if he is healthy he achieves Generativity, a rich, ripe stage of human existence already hinted at in prior chapters. \np. 201\n\n  \n> Identity formation in adolescence is fostered by a curious fact of human nature; as we lose or separate ourselves from people that we love, we internalize them.\n\nThus, as adolescents turn to communes, to a college-on-the-oppositecoast, as adolescents consciously focus on all that is bad about their parents in order to extricate themselves from the backwards pull, they escape and take their parents with them.\np. 207\nNote: Internalizing attachment figures\n\n  \n> In part, it was because the stages of the life cycle are often invisible to the participant until after the fact.\n\nIn part, as it is in character disorder, much of the turmoil in adolescence is invisible to the protagonist for purely defensive reasons.\np. 213\n\n  \n> Yet he was the last man that the Study had ever expected to have an exciting love attair.\np. 222\nNote: shows the zeitgeist\n\n  \n> \" They were unaware that the heightened sexuality that so frightened them in their daughters was often a projection of their own forbidden wishes toward their suddenly attractive children.\np. 225\nNote: About the lacking kinship between parents and their adolescent children\n\n  \n> If bitterness is to be avoided, the promises and dreams of the thirties must be reviewed as nostalgia.\np. 233\n\n  \n> Parenthetically, with advancing age, sexual differentiation be\ncomes less sharp.\n\nAs they grow older, women grow facial hair,\nand men's beards grow more slowly.\n\nWomen become flat\nchested; their voices deepen; their facial features sharpen, and\nthe estrogens that may inhibit dominance decrease.\n\nThe breasts\nof old men grow, their faces soften, and the androgenic hormones facilitating dominance decrease?\n\nPerhaps older women may frighten younger men precisely because they have grown more comtortable with assertive impulses.\n\nPerhaps older men may appeal to younger women precisely because they can let themselves become more gentle and nurturant.\np. 234\n\n  \n> This book supports a fourth solution.\n\nIn the case of measles, the\nchild's symptoms display not malfunction, but adaptation; the\nbody deploys a rash, a fever, and a cough to cope with and to\nmaster an invading virus.\n\nIn virtually every case of measles, the\nbody recovers without antibiotics, without moral resolutions,\nand without pretending measles does not exist.\n\nLet us entertain\nthe possibility that mental illness, like the symptoms of measles,\nreflects our efforts to adapt to pathologic conflict (be it viral,\ndemonic, or emotional).\n\nLet us suppose that mental illness, like\nmeasles, is not a deficit state, that it is neither immoral nor\nimaginary, but instead that the symptoms of mental illness re\nflect an unconscious effort at mastery through an aggregate of\ndefense mechanisms.\n\nThe counterargument is that the body masters measles in several days, while mental illness, like Wagner\nian opera, goes on and on.\n\nBut as we shall see, mental illness\ndoes not always go on indefinitely:\np. 238\n\n  \n> Usually, mental illness manifests itself through a defensive regression — the retreat from adaptive mechanisms at one level to those at a less mature level.\n\nMany psychiatrists regard regression per se as a defense mechanism.\n\nBut the user of regression has to regress to some other state — to some other mode of adaptation.\n\nIn Chapter 9 regression was depicted as the process by which in adult life immature adaptive mechanisms (e.g., projection, schizoid fantasy, and hypochondriasis) reappeared and resulted in \"mental illness.\"\np. 241\n\n  \n> Like many people who use repression as a major defense, Francis reported that he preferred \"emotional thinking to rational thought,\"\np. 245\nNote: And people who use isolation prefer rational thought to emotional thinking!\n\n  \n> In high school Herman had identified with his paranoid mother and believed that the other children were out to get him.\n\nAfter\ncollege, because he dared to marry the one close friend he had\nhad in high school, he believed that it was his wife's mother, not\nhis own, who wished to stand in the way.\n\nCrabbe also imagined\nthat his university would persecute him for getting married\nat twenty-three without telling them.\n\nHis fears of retaliation\nreflected a projection of his real guilt about escaping from his mother's embrace.\np. 248\n\n  \n> Fantasy could be replaced by its logical\nsuccessor, intellectualization.\n\nCrabbe's projection gave way to its first cousin, displacement.\np. 250\n\n  \n> As a nypochondriacal adolescent, Dr. Camille had been quite unconscious that his teelings affected his body.\n\nUnder stress, he believed that he was without physical symptoms.\n\nAs a thirtytwo-year-old, however, emotional stress now led Camille to complain of indigestion, abdominal pains, cold hands, and gastric distress.\n\nIn other words, he no longer saw the manifestations of psychological stress as tangible disease but correctly viewed them as physiologic evidence of emotion.\np. 255\n\n  \n> The thirty-two items used to describe health are defined in Appendix C, and already the comparison of Mr. Goodhart and Dr. Tarrytown has ottered an overview of the general scheme.\n\nIn brief, adjustment in each of four areas work, social, psychological, and medical was assessed by separate eight-item scales.\n\nWork was assessed by items like income, success relative to father, and consistency of promotion.\n\nSocial adjustment was assessed by operationally defined items reflecting stable marriage, friendship patterns, and relations with parents and siblings.\n\nPsychological adjustment was measured by length of vacations, job enjoyment, psychiatric visits, and use of mood-altering drugs.\n\nItems reflecting medical adjustment included days of sick leave, number of hospitalizations, and subjective assessment of health.\n\nObviously, if the scale were to be valid in less-privileged samples, the parameters of the objective behaviors leg, income would have to be adjusted.)\np. 261\n\n  \n> But defenses that channel rather than block inner life and\n\naffect — namely, suppression, anticipation, altruism, and dis\n\nplacement were far more common among the Best Outcomes (see Figure 1).\n\nDefenses that removed, denied, or dammed inner life reaction formation, dissociation, and the immature defense mechanisms — were far more common among poor outcomes.\np. 276\n\n  \n> \"Once we have determined objectively those tactors of ability, character, will, etc., which are the empirical not theoretical — correlates of 'strong' and 'weak' egos, we will have escaped the relativity of the usual definitions which determine ego strength from the individual ego's relation to its id or superego.\n\nWe will then be able to compare the ego strength of different individuals.'\np. 278\nNote: The concept of ego strength is still a mystery to me. \n\n  \n> One explanation why aggressiveness seemed so healthy in the Grant Study men is that the finding is an artifact of sample selection.\n\nIn a Victorian sense, all the men in the Study were so well brought up.\n\nOften toilet trained at one, valedictorians at sixteen, they worked hard to get honors at a difficult college and then polished themselves at graduate schools.\n\nPerhaps among socially disadvantaged men, where aggression might be more dangerous and disorganizing, the do-gooders would seem healthier than the Kowalskis.\n\nPerhaps aggression in overtrained, overcivilized, and overcooperative men is a saving grace.\n\nIf undisciplined floods are natural disasters, well-channeled torrents become the servant of man.\np. 278\nNote: Fascinating perspective on aggression in educated men versus uneducated men\n\n  \n> Kagan has shown that aggressiveness in a young child is correlated with effectiveness and competence as an\n\nThis is in contrast with the fact that violent adults have otten themselves been beaten as children.\n\nViolence and aggression are different.\n\nThe violent criminal is raised in an environment that has been hostile toward him; the successful adult has been raised in an environment that has tolerated his or her aggression (assertive competence).\np. 279\n\n  \n> in retrospect, adult outcome can be explained.\n\nThe crazy aunt, the rejecting mother, the clubfoot, the bad neighborhood in psychological biography, hindsight permits all the pieces to fall obediently into place.\n\nHowever, clinicians are often blind to the Procrustean maneuvers that they employ to fit past history into their psychiatric formulations.\np. 284\n\n  \n> As Erikson has written, children need to be patiently taught basic trust, autonomy, initiative then adult games, friends, vacations, and social supports may follow.\np. 295\n\n  \n> First, to be unloved in childhood was to be unable to play in middle life.\np. 295\n\n  \n> For example, as a psychoanalyst, I was tempted to explain Lovelace's fear of sex retrospectively and to blame it on an operation he had had on his groin at ten.\n\nBut by coincidence, Lucky, too, had required genital surgery at the same age.\n\nUnlike Lovelace, Lucky always exhibited considerable curiosity about sex.\"\np. 297\nNote: Lol\n\n  \n> The Worst Outcomes were twice as likely as the Best Outcomes to have a mentally ill parent.\np. 297\n\n  \n> the capacity to love — or what social scientists call \"capacity for object relations\"\np. 307\n\n  \n> The Lonely also inhabited worlds more profoundly distorted by\ntheir adaptive mechanisms. In fact, there was a powerful associa-\ntion between a man's capacity to love and the maturational level\nat which he defended himself.\np. 309\nNote: The more primitive, the more you distort the world you live in. \n\n  \n> However, the defenses ot dissociation and reaction formation (i.e., the adaptive modes that let the user substitute happy myths to deny unpleasant emotional reality)\np. 321\n\n  \n> In the ancient world Olympic gods acted out all man's projected wishes; if a man could but be as powerful as Zeus, he could do as he liked.\n\nThen, as religions matured, such apparitions were replaced by talion laws and rigid commandments (reaction formations graven in stone) against sin, which had to be internalized and never broken; man conceived of fallen angels who were to blame if he did sin.\n\nBetween ages three and eight, the same process goes on in children the world over.\n\nThe acting out of the Greek gods is replaced with Old Testament projection and reaction formation.\n\nThen, as children mature further, Piaget has observed that they believe that the sinner's intention is more important than the act; and as in the New Testament, the concept of mercy softens the child's eye-for-an-eye and tooth-for-a-tooth morality. In each generation children retrace the steps that led Western moralists from Mount Olympus to Mosaic law to the Sermon on the Mount.\np. 341\n\n  \n> that mature morality includes \"the ability to predict long range consequences ot action (anticipation) and the capacity to prefer the distant greater gratification to the immediate lesser gratification\" (suppression), and that both these developmental processes involve the ability to predict the reaction of others to one's actions\" (implicit in my concept of altruism).\np. 343\nNote: Moral lens on mature defences\n\n  \n> Put differently, as the men grew older, the gods of their under\nstanding became less important to them as surrogate Old Testa\nment consciences and served rather as a more fully assimilated\nbut quite invisible trusted power behind the universe, a power\nthat catalyzed what Erikson calls \"belief in the species, \" without\nwhich generativity is impossible.\np. 346\n\n  \n> In the symposium, Erik Erikson, a scholar clearly capable of stepping outside of the parochial Christian world view, wrote that \"the ethical rule of adulthood is to do to others what will help them, even as it helps you to grow”.\np. 349\nNote: Here, he’s essentially reworking the Golden Rule. Traditional Christianity says “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” which is reciprocity framed as empathy. Erikson’s twist is developmental: the moral imperative of adulthood is not just reciprocity, but mutual growth. Helping others should also foster your own expansion of capacity, and vice versa. That’s not self-sacrifice in the Christian ascetic sense, but a generative reciprocity where the self and the other advance together.\n\n  \n> Slowly, Alan Poe walked me to a cable car; and as the San Francisco drizzle fell, he told me, \"I feel I'm an inherently and basically happy man.\"\n\nHe added that he wondered how \"those people felt who had not followed their inner light.\"\n\nFinally, he closed our interview with an anecdote of someone who, at the height of World War II, had asked Winston Churchill, \"Are you of good cheer?\"\np. 355\nNote: Lovely alternative and more modern view on health. More relativistic. More “who’s to say”. \n\n  \n> If you feel Goodhart's altruism healthier than Tarrytown's prejudice, then you share my values; but it is not a value to say that altruism, as a process, differs from projection, and to observe that empirically it has different social consequences.\np. 362\nNote: Value-free residual of the book\n\n  \n> In a brilliant rebuttal to Peter Sedgwick, Leo Kass, a research\n\nprofessor\n in bio-ethics and neurology, points out that health lit\n\nerally means \"wholeness\" and to heal means to \"make whole.\"\n\nHe redefines health as \"an activity of the living body in accor\ndance with its specific excellences, \" and then expands this detini\ntion more poetically: \"What, for example, is a healthy squirrel?\"\n\nKass asks.\n\n\"Not a\npicture of a squirrel, not really or fully the sleeping squirrel, not\neven the aggregate of his normal blood pressure, serum calcium,\ntotal body zinc, normal digestion, fertility, and the like.\n\nRather,\nthe healthy squirrel is a bushy-tailed fellow, who looks and acts\nlike a squirrel; who leaps through the trees with great daring;\nwho gathers, buries, and covers but later uncovers and recovers\nhis acorns; who perches out on a limb cracking his nuts, sniffing\nthe air for smells of danger, alert, cautious, with his tail beating\nrhythmically; who chatters and plays and courts and mates and\nrears his young in large improbable looking homes at the tops of\ntrees; who fights with vigor and forages with cunning; who shows\nspiritedness, even anger, and more prudence than many human\nbeings.\n\n\"To sum up: Health is a natural standard or norm — not a moral norm, not a 'value' as opposed to a 'fact, not an obligation but a state of being that reveals itself in activity.\np. 364\nNote: Health as wholeness\n\n  \n> But most of what is called illness in textbooks and in our diagnostic nomenclature — the neuroses, the depressions, and the personality disorders — are merely outward evidence of inward struggles to adapt to life.\n\nThey reflect ongoing adaptive processes that someone has noticed and reified with a label.\n\nIn other words, most mental illness is more like the red tender swelling around a fracture that immobilizes it so that it may heal and less like the tangible biochemical defect of diabetes.\np. 369\n\n  \n> Understanding a ditterentiated hierarchy of defenses also allows us, even in the maelstrom of stress and emergency, to be helpful to others in a more rational manner.\n\nWe should respect the mature defenses and learn to admire and nourish them.\n\nStoicism, altruism, and artistic creativity should rarely be interfered with.\n\nConversely, the bigot and the delinquent must be either confronted or helped; we will almost never breach the immature defenses by argument, interpretation, or punishment.\n\nLast, if we wish to succeed at psychotherapy and interpretive counseling, we must try to pick our clients with neurotic defenses the displacement of the phobic, the isolation and undoing of the obsessive-compulsive, and the neurotic denial and repression of the hysteric.\n\nNeurotics will always change the most and be most grateful.\np. 371\n\n  \n> To view lives in cross-section is like trying to understand traffic by standing in the middle of Times Square.\n\nThe confusion is bewildering, and external events seem critical.\n\nThe time of day, the traffic lights, rain, and adventitious accidents seem allimportant.\n\nBut if each car is viewed in the perspective of time, suddenly each one acquires a defined, if not fully predictable, trajectory, and seen from afar, this trajectory is governed far more by the driver of the vehicle than by the complex outer social forces that affect Times Square.\np. 373",

    "content": "Open-ended questions, Mirroring, labelling emotions. Only then you come in with a request. People don’t notice you’re doing this. \n\nAsk a question someone’s going to respond with no to. This gives them the sense they’re in control. \nHow to get a no?\n- Ask them what they *don’t* want\n- Mislabel their emotions on purpose\n\nA lack of a no serves as a canary in the coal mine and is a sign of confusion or hidden agenda in the other party.\n\n“Bel ik ongelegen?” Ipv “bel ik gelegen?”\n\nSamenvatten = parafraseren + labellen\n\nStart met: “Ik wil graag eerlijk onderhandelen, dus onderbreek als je vindt dat dat niet gebeurt”\n\nAnchor their emotions:\nJe gaat denken dat ik een slechte zakenman ben met een grote mond. *Toch wil ik je deze kans aanbieden voordat ik ermee naar iemand anders ga.*\n\nMensen in mijn positie bij andere GGZ-instellingen krijgen tussen de […] en de […] euro. \nNB Het laagste nummer moet het nummer zijn wat je eigenlijk wil. \n\nOneven getallen en niet afgeronde getallen:\n- Ik heb gehoord dat vergelijkbare kandidaten bij andere kandidaten tussen de 4350 en 5250 krijgen. \n\nStick to what and how questions\n\nGet a yes three times:\n- them agreeing\n- You labelling/summarizing and them saying that’s right\n- You asking a question i.e. what do we do if we get off track?\n\nBargaining:\n- Take 65% of target price\n- Use “how” and subtle “no’s” before incrementing\n- Increment to 85%, 95% then 100%. \n- End on round numbers\n\nPREPARE!!!!\n\nHow to prepare:\n1. Set both your best-case and worst-case scenario (the worst you’re willing to accept). \n2. Summarise the known facts that have lead up to the negotiation. What do they want? Why?\n3. Prepare 3-5 labels to perform an accusation audit. Anticipate how your counterpart feels about the facts you summarised. \nIt seems like … is valuable to you. It seems like you don't like … \nIt seems like you value …\nIt seems like … makes it easier.\nIt seems like you're reluctant to …\n4. Prepare 3-5 calibrated questions. This allows moving beyond what the party demands, to what motivates them to do so. \nWhat are we trying to accomplish? \nHow is that worthwhile? \nWhat's the core issue here?\nHow does that affect things? What's the biggest challenge you face? \nHow does this fit into what the objective is? \n5. Identify deal-killers\nHow does this affect the rest of your team? \nHow on board are the people not on this call? \nWhat do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area? \nWhat are we up against here? What is the biggest challenge you face? \nHow does making a deal with us affect things? \nWhat happens if you do nothing? What does doing nothing cost you? \nHow does making this deal resonate with what your company prides itself on? \n\n*Be ready to label in response:*\nIt seems like … is important. \nIt seems you feel like my company is in a unique position to …\nIt seems like you are worried that …\n\n6. Think of noncash offers. What does the counterpart have that you might want? Eg free days. \n\n---\n\n# 2023-09-21 15:38:46 - Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It\n\n## Page 13\nIn my short stay I realized that without a deep understanding of human psychology, without the acceptance that we are all crazy, irrational, impulsive, emotionally driven animals, all the raw intelligence and mathematical logic in the world is little help in the fraught, shifting interplay of two people negotiating.\n\n## Page 15\nTheir system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenets. \n1. Separate the person—the emotion—from the problem; \n2. Don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; \n3. Work cooperatively to generate win-win options; \n4. Establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions.\n\n## Page 17\n> “How am I supposed to do that?”\n>\n> *Note: hoe zie je dat voor je, of hoe zou dat moeten werken*\n\n## Page 68\nThen, after pausing, ask solution-based questions or simply label their effect:\n> “What about this doesn’t work for you?”\n> “What would you need to make it work?”\n> “It seems like there’s something here that bothers you.”\n>\n> People have a need to say, “No.” So don’t just hope to hear it at some point; get them to say it early.\n>\n> *Note: what to say after a no*\n\n## Page 86\nI wrote a two-page document that instructed Benjie to change course. We were going to use nearly every tactic in the active listening arsenal:\n1. **Effective Pauses:** Silence is powerful. We told Benjie to use it for emphasis, to encourage Sabaya to keep talking until eventually, like clearing out a swamp, the emotions were drained from the dialogue.\n2. **Minimal Encouragers:** Besides silence, we instructed using simple phrases, such as “Yes,” “OK,” “Uh-huh,” or “I see,” to effectively convey that Benjie was now paying full attention to Sabaya and all he had to say.\n3. **Mirroring:** Rather than argue with Sabaya and try to separate Schilling from the “war damages,” Benjie would listen and repeat back what Sabaya said.\n4. **Labeling:** Benjie should give Sabaya’s feelings a name and identify with how he felt. “It all seems so tragically unfair, I can now see why you sound so angry.”\n5. **Paraphrase:** Benjie should repeat what Sabaya is saying back to him in Benjie’s own words. This, we told him, would powerfully show him you really do understand and aren’t merely parroting his concerns.\n6. **Summarize:** A good summary is the combination of rearticulating the meaning of what is said plus the acknowledgment of the emotions underlying that meaning (paraphrasing + labeling = summary). We told Benjie he needed to listen and repeat the “world according to Abu Sabaya.” He needed to fully and completely summarize all the nonsense that Sabaya had come up with about war damages and fishing rights and five hundred years of oppression. And once he did that fully and completely, the only possible response for Sabaya, and anyone faced with a good summary, would be “that’s right.”\n>\n> *Note: summary of useful tactics*\n\n## Page 127\nsituation:\n> - What about this is important to you?\n> - How can I help to make this better for us?\n> - How would you like me to proceed?\n> - What is it that brought us into this situation?\n> - How can we solve this problem?\n> - What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?\n> - How am I supposed to do that?\n> *Note: good open-ended calibrated questions*",

    "excerpt": "Secondary literature\n- (Kelmendi, 2020-09-21)",
    "content": "## Secondary literature\n- ([Kelmendi, 2020-09-21](zotero://select/items/1_S6S9P7M5))\n\n---\n\nIn \"Madness and Civilization,\" Michel Foucault explores the historical transformation of how Western society has conceptualized and dealt with madness from the Middle Ages to the modern era. \n\n### In madness and civilization, what does Foucault mean with unreason?\n\nIn \"Madness and Civilization,\" Michel Foucault uses the term \"unreason\" to refer to a complex concept that represents more than just insanity or madness. For Foucault, unreason is not simply the absence of reason, but a kind of \"other\" to reason, embodying everything that society and its rational structures reject, exclude, or cannot understand.\n\nUnreason, in Foucault's perspective, is a historical and cultural construction. In pre-modern times, madness was seen as a form of unreason intertwined with reason, often having a certain wisdom or insight that reason lacked. However, as society became more \"rational\" during the Enlightenment, madness came to be seen as the opposite of reason, something purely negative to be confined and controlled, thereby losing its previous positive or insightful aspects.\n\nThis shift in perception and treatment of madness is a key theme in \"Madness and Civilization.\" Foucault challenges the traditional narrative that the development of psychiatric institutions represented progress and humanitarian treatment of the mentally ill, instead arguing that this represented a new form of social control and exclusion of unreason.\n\n### What does he mean with the passions?\n\nIn \"Madness and Civilization,\" Michel Foucault uses the term \"passions\" in the context of his exploration of how madness was understood and treated in different historical periods. During the Classical Age, the passions were considered a central part of human nature and experience. They were thought to be strong emotions that could distort reason and thus lead to madness if they became too intense or unbalanced.\n\nFoucault explores how this understanding of madness as an imbalance of the passions changed over time. During the Enlightenment, as a scientific and medical understanding of madness began to develop, the focus shifted from the passions to the brain and body. Madness was increasingly seen not as a result of unbalanced passions, but as a physical or biological disorder.\n\nIn this context, \"passions\" can be seen as representing a broader historical and philosophical shift in understanding of the human self and its relation to madness, from a focus on emotion, experience, and the soul, to a focus on the physical body and brain.\n\n### What does Foucault mean with delirum, especially melancholic delirium?\n\nWhen Foucault discusses \"delirium,\" especially \"melancholic delirium,\" he is delving into the historical perception of these conditions rather than providing a clinical definition or description.\n\nA few points to consider:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Foucault's exploration reaches back to times when the modern clinical understanding of mental health was not yet developed. In the early periods, delirium was understood as a discourse, a narrative the mad person would produce, which deviated from reason. It was a manifestation of the madness in their speech.\n\n2. **Melancholic Delirium**: In the context of the early modern period, melancholia was often linked with ideas about black bile (following humoral theory) and was seen as a type of depressive state where an individual would be consumed with sorrowful ruminations. When combined with \"delirium,\" melancholic delirium could be seen as the irrational, sorrowful ruminations and narratives produced by individuals with melancholia. It wasn't just sadness, but a deep, consuming sorrow paired with a disconnection from reason.\n\n3. **Shifts in Understanding**: For Foucault, one of the crucial transformations in the understanding of madness occurred when madness went from being perceived as a type of moral or spiritual failure (or even a type of wisdom in its own right) to being seen as a medical or psychiatric condition in need of confinement and treatment. The medicalization of madness is a recurring theme, with \"melancholic delirium\" serving as one historical manifestation of how madness was understood.\n\n#### Power and knowledge\n\nCentral to Foucault's work is the relationship between power and knowledge. In \"Madness and Civilization,\" he examines how institutions (like asylums) and the medical profession wielded power over those deemed mad. Concepts like \"delirium\" or \"melancholic delirium\" aren't just neutral descriptions but are bound up in these power relations.\n\n### Hospitals and confinement in medieval Europe\nSource: [Hôtel-Dieu, Paris - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel-Dieu,_Paris)\n\nIt's like hospitals started out being just places where all the sick would concentrate instead of places where the sick get cured. As such, it would not have been a pleasure to work in a hospital, but rather a death sentence.\n\n> From the 15th to the 16th centuries, it went from 303 beds to about 500, but the number of patients would regularly hover around 700 and would often exceed 1500 during times of conflict, food shortages or epidemics. It is estimated that the number of admissions was 25,000 per year during the 16th century. \n\nAnd: \n\n> At one point, beds which had a width of 1.3 metres, were meant to hold 2 or 3 patients each; arranged heel to head. Later, beds meant for one or two patients were installed, but these often had to accommodate more patients than intended. For much of the Middle Ages, there was no surgical ward and surgical operations were performed in the patient’s bed, with fellow patients and bedmates as onlookers.\n\n[**YouTube](https://youtu.be/8Q1uSC1skkY) Must watch 8:17**\n\n**11:18**\nMental health care laws limiting constrainment and adding an element of a court of law that has to approve for forced care, it is a way to constrain the power of otherwise dictator-like authorities, meaning a hospital which has full decision power on what happens to the lives of their patients with no boundaries, as was the case in the past.\n\n21;44 doctors were not medical doctors, but moral doctors. \nDo we STILL use our morals to deem a person sane?\n\n[YouTube](https://youtu.be/-UMcq5Rgm1k)**Also very very good**\n6:30\nMadness is rooted in the moral world. It asks: “what do we condemn?”\n\n**About p 100:** Foucault says in Madness and Civilization, \"...the circle of day and night is the law of the classical world, the most reduced but the most demanding of the world's necessities, the most inevitable but the simplest of nature's legalities.\" Later, he says, \"...madness designates the equinox between the vanity of night's hallucinations and the non-being of night's judgments.\" And then he proceeds to talk about a play. Can you explain to me, in simple language, what Foucault is trying to say here?\n\nOf course! Michel Foucault's \"Madness and Civilization\" is a dense and philosophical exploration of the history of madness, its treatment, and its cultural implications. The lines you've quoted touch upon intricate ideas, but let's break them down:\n\n1. **\"...the circle of day and night is the law of the classical world...\"**: Foucault is referring to the cyclical nature of day and night as representative of the norms and structures of the classical world. The transition between day and night is predictable, expected, and a fundamental aspect of nature. By referring to it as a \"law,\" he emphasizes its inescapable and governing nature.\n\n2. **\"...madness designates the equinox between the vanity of night's hallucinations and the non-being of night's judgments.\"**: This is a poetic way of saying that madness exists in a liminal space, a boundary or middle ground between two extremes. On one side, there's the \"vanity of night's hallucinations,\" suggesting the fleeting and unreal nature of visions or delusions. On the other side, there's the \"non-being of night's judgments,\" which points to the emptiness or lack of substance in judgments made in the dark, both literally and metaphorically. In essence, madness is neither wholly unreal like a hallucination nor completely devoid of substance; it's somewhere in between.\n\nIn simpler terms: Foucault is highlighting the rigid structures and expectations of the classical world (represented by the day-night cycle) and posits that madness exists in a complex space between reality and unreality, between meaningfulness and meaninglessness. \n\n**Clarifying YT comment:**\nNo, Foucault's argument is NOT that insanity was CREATED within reason. It is that the modern institutional systems that were created to deal with the insane, in other words mental hospitals, developed out of a major shift in how society viewed the mad - from a sacred figure, keeper of an unreachable knowledge, to a figure marked by the moral guilt of being a fallacy in the social order. And this shift, according to Foucault, is attributable to the beginning of what we generally consider the start of the age of Reason. Obviously, this new system of dealing with the mad consequently transformed not only how we view the mad, but the very nature of insanity itself.\n\nAnother interesting video:\n[YouTube](https://youtu.be/Ex5_81V530M)\n\n## Aspects of Madness\n\n**What is delirium?**\n- Diseased perceptions are taken for realities. (Verstoorde realiteitstoetsing)\n- An essential break with truth\n- The error common to all madness (Gemene deler met andere vormen van waanzin)\n- Melancholie is een partieel delirium omdat mensen niet volledig buiten de realiteit staan. \n\n### Humors and spirits as a phenomenology of melancholy\n\nIn ancient and medieval medicine, the body was believed to be governed by four humors: blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm. Imbalances in these humors were thought to cause diseases and emotional disorders. In addition to the humors, \"spirits\" (often referred to as \"animal spirits\") were believed to be subtle, vaporous substances that transmitted impulses and played a role in mood and cognition. The \"spirits\" moved through the body's nervous system and were believed to be particularly active in the brain.\n\nUp until the 17th century, humors and spirits were the main theoretical framework for mental and physical problems alike. Melancholia was thought to arise from an excess of the melancholic humor, which was \"thick in consistency, cold and dry in temperament\" (p. 113). The qualities of the melancholic humor *explained* the phenomena observed in the melancholic person. However, the influence of the humors reaches further. From the melancholic humor, vapors were thought to arise to the brain. Vapors of an \"acidic and corrosive\" nature, that would cast a \"shadow over the mind, along with that acid bitterness which corrodes thought and feeling alike\". Already we can begin to see that the qualities of the melancholic humor and the symptoms of the melancholic begin to dissolve into each other. In fact, Foucault describes the properties of these vapors not only as an explanation of the symptoms, but also as a \"phenomenology of melancholic experience\" (p. 116). \n\n**The transformation towards positivism** (p 123)\nWhen Foucault says that \"medical thought acceded to positivism,\" he is pointing out a historical shift in how medical knowledge was approached and validated. Prior to this shift, medical understandings were often based on a mix of observation, traditional knowledge, philosophical reasoning, and other less empirical methods. With the rise of positivism, there was a growing emphasis on grounding medical knowledge in rigorous scientific research, empirical data, and quantifiable results.\n\nThis change had profound implications for the understanding and treatment of madness (or mental illness). Under the influence of positivism, the understanding of madness started to shift from a more qualitative and perhaps even mystical or moral understanding to one that sought to categorize, diagnose, and treat based on empirical observations and data. It signified a move towards seeking objective, measurable criteria for defining and treating mental disorders.\n\n> \"No doubt this entire universe of heat and cold, of humidity and dryness, reminded medical thought, about to accede to positivism, of the circumstances of its own origin. But this blazon of images was not simply reminiscence; it was also an undertaking.\n> In order to form the practical experience of mania or melancholia, this gravitation, against a background of images, of qualities attracted to each other by a whole system of sensuous and affective affinities was essential. If mania, if melancholia henceforth assumed the aspects our science knows them by, it is not because in the course of centuries we have learned to \"open our eyes\" to real symptoms; it is not because we have purified our perception to the point of transparency; it is because in the experience of madness, these concepts were organized around certain qualitative themes that lent them their unity, gave them their significant coherence, made them finally perceptible. We have passed from a simple notional description (fury without fever, *delirious idée fixe*) to a qualitative realm, apparently less organized, simpler, less precisely limited, but which alone was able to constitute recognizable, palpable units really present in the total experience of madness. The field of observation of these diseases was partitioned into landscapes that obscurely gave them their style and their structure. On the one hand, a sodden, almost diluvian world, where man remained deaf, blind, and numb to all that was not his one terror: a world simplified in the extreme, and immoderately enlarged in a single one of its details.\n> On the other, a parched and desertic world, a panic world where all was flight, disorder, instantaneous gesture. It was the rigor of these themes in their cosmic form - not the approximations of an observing caution - which organized the experience (already almost our own experience) of mania and melancholia.\" (p 123)\n\nThis *delirious idée fixe* seems unlike our modern conception of melancholy, or depression. It seems to overlap with other modern disorders of which have *overvalued ideas* (overwaardige denkbeelden), compulsive thoughts, or delusions. Considering comorbodity of such disorders with mood and anxiety symptoms makes this not unthinkable. \n\n### A reversal: pre-existing images preceded observation\n\n> \"The essential thing is that the enterprise did not proceed from observation to the construction of explanatory images; that on the contrary, the images assured the initial role of synthesis, that their *organizing force* made possible a structure of perception, in which at last the symptoms could attain their significant value and be organized as the visible presence of the truth.\" (p 128)\n\nThis quote delves into the foundational concepts of how knowledge, especially in the context of madness and mental illness, is constructed and understood in historical and cultural frameworks.\n\nFoucault is highlighting a reversal in the typical process of understanding. Rather than observing behaviors and then creating models to explain them, societal beliefs and stereotypes about madness shaped the very way these behaviors were observed and understood in the first place. The cultural narrative around madness determined the significance and meaning of its symptoms. This perspective challenges traditional notions of objective observation and suggests that our understanding of phenomena like madness is deeply influenced by cultural and societal contexts.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n1. **\"The enterprise did not proceed from observation to the construction of explanatory images;\"**: Traditional scientific thinking suggests that we first observe something, and then from those observations, we construct models, theories, or \"explanatory images\" to understand and explain what we've observed. Foucault is saying that when it comes to understanding madness, this isn't how things have historically worked.\n2. **\"the images assured the initial role of synthesis,\"**: Instead of observations leading to the creation of images or models, pre-existing cultural and societal images or models of madness played a foundational role. These \"images\" can be thought of as cultural narratives, stereotypes, or preconceived notions about madness.\n3. **\"their organizing force made possible a structure of perception,\"**: These pre-existing models or images structured the way people perceived and interpreted the behavior of those deemed mad. The \"organizing force\" of these images created a lens or framework through which observations were made and understood.\n4. **\"in which at last the symptoms could attain their significant value and be organized as the visible presence of the truth\"**: Within this structured perception, the behaviors or symptoms of the mad were finally given meaning. The behaviors were not just random or inexplicable actions; they fit into the broader narrative provided by these pre-existing images of madness. In essence, these symptoms became \"proof\" or \"visible presence\" of the underlying truth or reality of madness as understood within that framework.\n\n### Vapors and spirits\nFrom the humors, through effervescence, vapors and spirits (which are animal spirits) rise to the brain.\n\n### Hysteria and Hypochondria\n\n> It is called a hypochondriacal disease when it attacks men \"in whom nature makes an effort to be rid of excess blood by vomiting or hemorrhoids\"; it is called a hysterical affection when it aincks women \"he course of whose periods is not as it should be. However, there is no essential difference between these two affections.\" (P 137)\n\nBoth diseases of the **nerves** since they affected all tissues alike, often simultaneously. It can be described as a “general vigilance in the nervous system” (p 145). \n\nMelancholia and mania are diseases of the humors. \n\nHypochondria was for men, hysteria for women, because: “Neither symptoms, in fact, nor even causes form the principle of separation between the diseases, but only the spatial solidarity of the body.”  This is a **moral** judgement. \n\n**Foucault tells the history of madness through the eyes of very abstract concepts such as unreason and morality, which act almost as characters in his story, with protagonists (the mysticism of the renaissance people?) and antagonists (unreason, morality). **\n\n226 - with the declaration of the rights of man, mad, men were assigned to reside in a hospital specifically designed for the mad, The former prison le bicetre Was assigned as the blaze where the madmen should go. Philip Pinel was the first person to treat these people.\n### Links\n- [De blauwe schuit (gedicht) - Wikipedia](https://nl.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_blauwe_schuit_(gedicht))",

Pirsig\n\n25\n\nAnd it occurred to me there is no manual that deals with the real business of motorcycle maintenance, the most important aspect of all. Caring about what you are doing is considered either unimportant or taken for granted\n\n35\n\nA copy of Thoreau's Walden -- which Chris has never heard and which can be read a hundred times without exhaustion. I try always to pick a book far over his head and read it as a basis for questions and answers, rather than without interruption. I read a sentence or two, wait for him to come up with his usual barrage of questions, answer them, then read another sentence or two. Classics read well this way. They must be written this way. Sometimes we have spent a whole evening reading and talking and discovered we have only covered two or three pages. It's a form of reading done a century ago -- when Chautauquas were popular. Unless you've tried it you can't imagine how pleasant it is to do it this way.\n \n\n42\n\nJohn gets his camera out.\nAfter a while he says, \"This is the hardest stuff in the world to photograph. You need a three-hundred-and-sixty degree lens, or something. You see it, and then you look down in the ground glass and it's just nothing. As soon as you put a border on it, it's gone.''\nI say, \"That's what you don't see in a car, I suppose.''\nSylvia says, \"Once when I was about ten we stopped like this by the road and I used half a roll of film taking pictures. And when the pictures came back I cried. There wasn't anything there.''\n\n58\n\nThe world of underlying form is an unusual object of discussion because it is actually a mode of discussion itself. You discuss things in terms of their immediate appearance or you discuss them in terms of their underlying form,\n\n61\n\nUnusual behavior tends to produce estrangement in others which tends to further the unusual behavior and thus the estrangement in self-stoking cycles until some sort of climax is reached\n\n62\n\nHis kind of rationality has been used since antiquity to remove oneself from the tedium and depression of one's immediate surroundings. What makes it hard to see is that where once it was used to get away from it all, the escape has been so successful that now it is the \"it all'' that the romantics are trying to escape. What makes his world so hard to see clearly is not its strangeness but its usualness. Familiarity can blind you too\n\n65\n\nIt is important to see this knife for what it is and not to be fooled into thinking that motorcycles or anything else are the way they are just because the knife happened to cut it up that way. It is important to concentrate on the knife itself.\n\n*very similar to sapolskys first lecture where he talks about dividing the spectrum up in bins. Also see my mushroom thoughts on the spectrum.*\n\n70\n\nTo see him you must see what he saw and when you are trying to see the vision of an insane man, an oblique route is the only way to come at it. Otherwise your own opinions block the way.\n\n75\n\nIt was explained to me finally that \"You have a new personality now.'' But this statement was no explanation at all. It puzzled me more than ever since I had no awareness at all of any \"old'' personality. If they had said, \"You are a new personality,'' it would have been much clearer. That would have fitted. They had made the mistake of thinking of a personality as some sort of possession, like a suit of clothes, which a person wears. But apart from a personality what is there? Some bones and flesh. A collection of legal statistics, perhaps, but surely no person. The bones and flesh and legal statistics are the garments worn by the personality, not the other way around.\n\n76\n\nclairvoyant\n\n96\n\nIf the purpose of scientific method is to select from among a multitude of hypotheses, and if the number of hypotheses grows faster than experimental method can handle, then it is clear that all hypotheses can never be tested. If all hypotheses cannot be tested, then the results of any experiment are inconclusive and the entire scientific method falls short of its goal of establishing proven knowledge.\n\n105\n\nThe questions he had asked about infinite hypotheses hadn't been of interest to science because they weren't scientific questions. Science cannot study scientific method without getting into a bootstrap problem that destroys the validity of its answers.\n\n108\n\nOne can see how both the informal and formal processes of hypothesis, experiment, conclusion, century after century, repeated with new material, have built up the hierarchies of thought which have eliminated most of the enemies of primitive man.\n\n109\n\nWhat is most astonishing about them is that almost everything he said years later is contained in them. It's frustrating to see how completely unaware he is at the time of the significance of what he is saying. It's like seeing someone handling, one by one, all the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle whose solution you know, and you want to tell him, \"Look, this fits here, and this fits here,'' but you can't tell him. And so he wanders blindly along one trail after another gathering one piece after another and wondering what to do with them, and you grit your teeth when he goes off on a false trail and are relieved when he comes back again, even though he is discouraged himself. \"Don't worry,'' you want to tell him. \"Keep going!''\n\n*lets hope this is me*\n\n111\n\nBut though all knowledge begins with experience it doesn't follow that it arises out of experience.''\nThis seems, at first, as though he is picking nits, but he isn't. As a result of this difference, Kant skirts right around the abyss of solipsism that Hume's path leads to and proceeds on an entirely new and different path of his own.\n\n112\n\nThe forms of space and time are applied to data as they are received from the object producing them. The a priori concepts have their origins in human nature so that they're neither caused by the sensed object nor bring it into being, but provide a kind of screening function for what sense data we will accept.\n\n114\n\nIt's quite a machine, this a priori motorcycle. If you stop to think about it long enough you'll see that it's the main thing. The sense data confirm it but the sense data aren't it.\n\n119\n\nLater he saw it was a kind of supertruth laugh. The best students always are flunking. Every good teacher knows that. It was a kind of laughter that destroys tensions produced by impossible situations and Ph?drus could have used some of it because at this time he was taking things way too seriously.\n\n130\n\nYou are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it's going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it's always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.\n\n150\n\nA student would always ask how the rule would apply in a certain special circumstance. Ph?drus would then have the choice of trying to fake through a made-up explanation of how it worked, or follow the selfless route and say what he really thought. And what he really thought was that the rule was pasted on to the writing after the writing was all done. It was post hoc, after the fact, instead of prior to the fact. And he became convinced that all the writers the students were supposed to mimic wrote without rules, putting down whatever sounded right, then going back to see if it still sounded right and changing it if it didn't.\n\n157\n\nQuality -- you know what it is, yet you don't know what it is. But that's self-contradictory. But some things are better than others, that is, they have more quality. But when you try to say what the quality is, apart from the things that have it, it all goes poof! There's nothing to talk about. But if you can't say what Quality is, how do you know what it is, or how do you know that it even exists? If no one knows what it is, then for all practical purposes it doesn't exist at all. But for all practical purposes it really does exist. What else are the grades based on? Why else would people pay fortunes for some things and throw others in the trash pile? Obviously some things are better than others -- but what's the \"betterness''? -- So round and round you go, spinning mental wheels and nowhere finding anyplace to get traction. What the hell is Quality? What is it?\n \n\n161\n\nFor every fact there is an infinity of hypotheses. The more you look the more you see\n\n163\n\nHe used the demonstrator to avoid talking in terms of principles of composition, all of which he had deep doubts about. He felt that by exposing classes to his own sentences as he made them, with all the misgivings and hang-ups and erasures, he would give a more honest picture of what writing was like than by spending class time picking nits in completed student work or holding up the completed work of masters for emulation\n\n165\n\nSuch a student, the demonstrator hypothesized, would go to his first class, get his first assignment and probably do it out of habit. He might go to his second and third as well. But eventually the novelty of the course would wear off and, because his academic life was not his only life, the pressure of other obligations or desires would create circumstances where he just would not be able to get an assignment in.\nSince there was no degree or grading system he would incur no penalty for this. Subsequent lectures which presumed he'd completed the assignment might be a little more difficult to understand, however, and this difficulty, in turn, might weaken his interest to a point where the next assignment, which he would find quite hard, would also be dropped. Again no penalty.\nIn time his weaker and weaker understanding of what the lectures were about would make it more and more difficult for him to pay attention in class. Eventually he would see he wasn't learning much; and facing the continual pressure of outside obligations, he would stop studying, feel guilty about this and stop attending class. Again, no penalty would be attached.\nBut what had happened? The student, with no hard feelings on anybody's part, would have flunked himself out. Good! This is what should have happened. He wasn't there for a real education in the first place and had no real business there at all. A large amount of money and effort had been saved and there would be no stigma of failure and ruin to haunt him the rest of his life. No bridges had been burned.\nThe student's biggest problem was a slave mentality which had been built into him by years of carrot-andwhip grading, a mule mentality which said, \"If you don't whip me, I won't work.'' He didn't get whipped. He didn't work. And the cart of civilization, which he supposedly was being trained to pull, was just going to have to creak along a little slower without him.\nThis is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of civilization, \"the system,'' is pulled by mules. This is a common, vocational, \"location'' point of view, but it's not the Church attitude. The Church attitude is that civilization, or \"the system'' or \"society'' or whatever you want to call it, is best served not by mules but by free men. The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees is not to punish mules or to get rid of them but to provide an environment in which that mule can turn into a free man.\n\n166\n\nThe hypothetical student, still a mule, would drift around for a while. He would get another kind of education quite as valuable as the one he'd abandoned, in what used to be called the \"school of hard knocks.'' Instead of wasting money and time as a high-status mule, he would now have to get a job as a low-status mule, maybe as a mechanic. Actually his real status would go up. He would be making a contribution for a change. Maybe that's what he would do for the rest of his life. Maybe he'd found his level. But don't count on it.\nIn time…six months; five years, perhaps…a change could easily begin to take place. He would become less and less satisfied with a kind of dumb, day-to-day shopwork. His creative intelligence, stifled by too much theory and too many grades in college, would now become reawakened by the boredom of the shop. Thousands of hours of frustrating mechanical problems would have made him more interested in machine design. He would like to design machinery himself. He'd think he could do a better job. He would try modifying a few engines, meet with success, look for more success, but feel blocked because he didn't have the theoretical information. He would discover that when before he felt stupid because of his lack of interest in theoretical information, he'd now find a brand of theoretical information which he'd have a lot of respect for, namely, mechanical engineering\n\n168\n\nAt the end of the quarter the students were asked to write an essay evaluating the system.\n\n*grades vs lvl of learning is aother example of goodharts law*\n\n168\n\nThis surprising result supported a hunch he had had for a long time: that the brighter, more serious students were the least desirous of grades, possibly because they were more interested in the subject matter of the course, whereas the dull or lazy students were the most desirous of grades, possibly because grades told them if they were getting by\n\n169\n\nGrades really cover up failure to teach. A bad instructor can go through an entire quarter leaving absolutely nothing memorable in the minds of his class, curve out the scores on an irrelevant test, and leave the impression that some have learned and some have not.\n\n170\n\nHe could think of no possible way he could tell them what they should work toward without falling back into the trap of authoritarian, didactic teaching. But how can you put on the blackboard the mysterious internal goal of each creative person?\n\n174\n\nWhen I say, \"Quality cannot be defined,'' I'm really saying formally, \"I'm stupid about Quality.''\n\n177\n\nBy reversing a basic rule that all things which are to be taught must first be defined, he had found a way out of all this. He was pointing to no principle, no rule of good writing, no theory…but he was pointing to something, nevertheless, that was very real, whose reality they couldn't deny. The vacuum that had been created by the withholding of grades was suddenly filled with the positive goal of Quality, and the whole thing fit together.\n\n185\n\nThe wave of crystallization rolled ahead. He was seeing two worlds, simultaneously. On the intellectual side, the square side, he saw now that Quality was a cleavage term. What every intellectual analyst looks for. You take your analytic knife, put the point directly on the term Quality and just tap, not hard, gently, and the whole world splits, cleaves, right in two…hip and square, classic and romantic, technological and humanistic…and the split is clean. There's no mess. No slop. No little items that could be one way or the other. Not just a skilled break but a very lucky break. Sometimes the best analysts, working with the most obvious lines of cleavage, can tap and get nothing but a pile of trash. And yet here was Quality; a tiny, almost unnoticeable fault line; a line of illogic in our concept of the universe; and you tapped it, and the whole universe came apart, so neatly it was almost unbelievable. He wished Kant were alive. Kant would have appreciated it. That master diamond cutter. He would see. Hold Quality undefined. That was the secret\n\n226\n\nThe true work of the inventor consists in choosing among these combinations so as to eliminate the useless ones, or rather, to avoid the trouble of making them, and the rules that must guide the choice are extremely fine and delicate. It's almost impossible to state them precisely; they must be felt rather than formulated.\n\n241\n\nValue, the leading edge of reality, is no longer an irrelevant offshoot of structure. Value is the predecessor of structure. It's the preintellectual awareness that gives rise to it. Our structured reality is preselected on the basis of value, and really to understand structured reality requires an understanding of the value source from which it's derived\n\n*in other words: structure is determined by quality, which decides how the analytic knife cleaves reality, determining what parts you see.*\n\n243\n\nStuckness shouldn't be avoided. It's the psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It's this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation.\n\n250\n\nThe passions, the emotions, the affective domain of man's consciousness, are a part of nature's order too. The central part.\n\n*this ties drectly into tha book about \"edure and prevail\" i read with rana, which said emotions drive humanity forqard, while this book says they help us decide what facts to focus on.*\n\n251\n\nThis inner peace of mind occurs on three levels of understanding. Physical quietness seems the easiest to achieve, although there are levels and levels of this too, as attested by the ability of Hindu mystics to live buried alive for many days. Mental quietness, in which one has no wandering thoughts at all, seems more difficult, but can be achieved. But value quietness, in which one has no wandering desires at all but simply performs the acts of his life without desire, that seems the hardest.\n\n255\n\nSometimes, when thinking about this, I thought that the idea that one person's mind is accessible to another's is just a conversational illusion, just a figure of speech, an assumption that makes some kind of exchange between basically alien creatures seem plausible, and that really the relationship of one person to another is ultimately unknowable.\n\n262\n\nBookmark\n\n264\n\nout-of-sequence reassembly, intermittent failure and parts problems\n\n*wrong order, ghost setbacks, parts problems*\n\n265\n\nSo we preselect on the basis of Quality, or, to put it Ph?drus' way, the track of Quality preselects what data we're going to be conscious of, and it makes this selection in such a way as to best harmonize what we are with what we are becoming.\n\n*abt quality*\n\n269\n\nBookmark\n\n273\n\nA very strong case can be made for the statement that science grows by its mu answers more than by its yes or no answer. Yes or no confirms or denies a hypothesis. Mu says the answer is beyond the hypothesis.\n\n289\n\nThe inability of science to grasp Quality, as an object of enquiry, makes it impossible for science to provide a scale of values\n\n294\n\nThe term logos, the root word of \"logic,'' refers to the sum total of our rational understanding of the world. Mythos is the sum total of the early historic and prehistoric myths which preceded the logos. The mythos includes not only the Greek myths but the Old Testament, the Vedic Hymns and the early legends of all cultures which have contributed to our present world understanding. The mythos-over-logos argument states that our rationality is shaped by these legends, that our knowledge today is in relation to these legends as a tree is in relation to the little shrub it once was. One can gain great insights into the complex overall structure of the tree by studying the much simpler shape of the shrub. There's no difference in kind or even difference in identity, only a difference in size\n\n295\n\nIn cultures such as the Chinese, where subject-object relationships are not rigidly defined by grammar, one finds a corresponding absence of rigid subject-object philosophy. One finds that in the Judeo-Christian culture in which the Old Testament \"Word'' had an intrinsic sacredness of its own, men are willing to sacrifice and live by and die for words.\n\n309\n\nHis Quality and Plato's Good were so similar that if it hadn't been for some notes Ph?drus left I might have thought they were identical.\n\n317\n\nPh?drus is fascinated too by the description of the motive of \"duty toward self '' which is an almost exact translation of the Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes described as the \"one'' of the Hindus.\n\n320\n\nUnder Aristotle the \"Reader,'' whose knowledge of Trojan arete seems conspicuously absent, forms and substances dominate all. The Good is a relatively minor branch of knowledge called ethics; reason, logic, knowledge are his primary concerns. Arete is dead and science, logic and the University as we know it today have been given their founding charter: to find and invent an endless proliferation of forms about the substantive elements of the world and call these forms knowledge, and transmit these forms to future generations. As \"the system.'\n\n325\n\nWhat Ph?drus has been talking about as Quality, Socrates appears to have described as the soul, self-moving, the source of all things. There is no contradiction. There never really can be between the core terms of monistic philosophies. The One in India has got to be the same as the One in Greece. If it's not, you've got two. The only disagreements among the monists concern the attributes of the One, not the One itself. Since the One is the source of all things and includes all things in it, it cannot be defined in terms of those things, since no matter what thing you use to define it, the thing will always describe something less than the One itself. The One can only be described allegorically, through the use of analogy, of figures of imagination and speech\n\n329\n\nDialectic, which is the parent of logic, came itself from rhetoric. Rhetoric is in turn the child of the myths and poetry of ancient Greece. That is so historically, and that is so by any application of common sense. The poetry and the myths are the response of a prehistoric people to the universe around them made on the basis of Quality. It is Quality, not dialectic, which is the generator of everything we know\n\n339\n\nCoastal people never really know what the ocean symbolizes to landlocked inland people…what a great distant dream it is, present but unseen in the deepest levels of subconsciousness, and when they arrive at the ocean and the conscious images are compared with the subconscious dream there is a sense of defeat at having come so far to be so stopped by a mystery that can never be fathomed. The source of it all\n\n351\n\nThe pattern was looking for something to attach to and couldn't find anything. That's probably why grieving people feel such attachment to cemetery headstones and any material property or representation of the deceased. The pattern is trying to hang on to its own existence by finding some new material thing to center itself upon",

    "content": "14\n\nVanaf het moment dat het rendement op kapitaal de groei van de productie en het inkomen blijvend overtreft, wat in de negentiende eeuw het geval was en waarschijnlijk in de eenentwintigste eeuw weer de norm gaat worden, genereert het kapitalisme automatisch een willekeurige en onhoudbare ongelijkheid die de meritocratische waarden waarop onze democratische samenleving is gebaseerd, op losse schroeven zet.\n\n19\n\nIn Ricardo’s ogen was de enige logische en politiek bevredigende oplossing een steeds hogere belasting te heffen op de grondrente die de grondbezitters ontvingen.  \nWe zullen zien dat deze sombere voorspelling niet bewaarheid is geworden: de grondrente is inderdaad lange tijd heel hoog gebleven, maar uiteindelijk is de waarde van landbouwgrond onverbiddelijk afgenomen ten opzichte van andere vormen van rijkdom naarmate het aandeel van de landbouw in het nationaal inkomen afnam. Ricardo, die dit in de jaren 1810 schreef, kon op geen enkele wijze voorzien welke vlucht de technologische vooruitgang en de industriële groei in de daaropvolgende eeuw zouden nemen. Net als Malthus en Young kon hij zich niet voorstellen dat de mensheid ooit bevrijd zou zijn van de druk om zich met het verbouwen van voedsel bezig te houden.\n\n20\n\nHet probleem is dat het prijssysteem grenzen noch moraal kent.\n\n22\n\nDat neemt niet weg dat het kapitaal gedijde en de winsten uit de industrie in de jaren 1840-1850 zo overduidelijk toenamen – terwijl de arbeidslonen stagneerden – dat het voor iedereen zichtbaar was, ook al beschikte niemand in die tijd over representatieve nationale statistische gegevens. En in die context zijn de eerste communistische en socialistische bewegingen ontstaan.\n\n23\n\nte hebben afgerond, die na zijn dood door zijn vriend Engels gepubliceerd werden op basis van de soms wat obscure tekstfragmenten die Marx had nagelaten.  \nNet als Ricardo baseerde Marx zijn werk op de analyse van de interne logische tegenstrijdigheden van het kapitalistische systeem. Daarmee nam hij zowel afstand van de bourgeoiseconomen (die de markt als een zelfregulerend systeem beschouwden, dat wil zeggen in staat om zichzelf in evenwicht te houden, zonder grote afwijkingen, in overeenstemming met de ‘onzichtbare hand’ van Adam Smith en de ‘wet van vraag en aanbod’ van Say), als de utopische socialisten of proudhonisten, die volgens hem volstonden met het aan de kaak stellen van de ellende van de arbeidersklasse zonder een zuiver wetenschappelijke analyse te maken van de economische processen die hieraan ten grondslag lagen.7 Samengevat nam Marx het ricardiaanse model van de prijs van kapitaal en het schaarsteprincipe als uitgangspunt, en werkte hij de analyse van de dynamiek van het kapitaal verder uit in een wereld waarin het kapitaal vooral uit industrieel bezit bestond (machines, fabrieken, enzovoort) in plaats van uit grondbezit, en zich dus in feite ongelimiteerd kon vermeerderen.\n\n26\n\nWe moeten ons goed realiseren dat het zonder deze twee onmisbare en complementaire gegevensbronnen volstrekt onmogelijk zou zijn om de ongelijkheid in de inkomensverdeling te meten en de ontwikkeling daarvan op termijn te schatten. Weliswaar dateren de eerste pogingen om een schatting te maken van het nationaal inkomen, zowel in Frankrijk als in Engeland, uit het einde van de zeventiende en het begin van de achttiende eeuw, en zijn deze in de loop van de negentiende eeuw alleen maar in aantal toegenomen. Maar daarbij ging het steeds om geïsoleerde schattingen: pas in de twintigste eeuw, in het interbellum, werden op initiatief van economen als Kuznets en Kendrick in de vs, Bowley en Clark in Groot-Brittannië en Dugé en De Bernonville in Frankrijk de eerste jaarlijkse gegevensreeksen over het nationaal inkomen ontwikkeld. Dankzij deze allereerste gegevensbronnen kon het totale inkomen van een land berekend worden. Om de hoge inkomens en hun aandeel in het nationaal inkomen te kunnen schatten moet je ook over belastingaangiften beschikken: deze tweede gegevensbron kwam in alle landen beschikbaar toen er in de periode rond de Eerste Wereldoorlog bijna overal in Europa een progressieve belasting op het inkomen werd geheven (1913 in de vs, 1914 in Frankrijk, 1909 in Groot-Brittannië, 1922 in India, 1932 in Argentinië).\n\ninkomensongelijkheid kun je met het aandeel van de rijken in het bnp meten, maar daar is dus veel data voor nodig.\n\n32\n\nVreemd genoeg is het werk van Kuznets nooit systematisch voortgezet, deels doordat de historische en statistische studie van belastinggegevens in een soort academisch ‘niemandsland’ valt: te historisch voor economen en te economisch voor historici.\n\n33\n\nWe moeten niet vergeten dat inkomen altijd twee componenten omvat: enerzijds het inkomen uit arbeid (lonen, salarissen, premies, bonussen, resultaat uit overig werk, enzovoort, en andere beloningen die wettelijk beschouwd worden als inkomen uit arbeid), en anderzijds het inkomen uit kapitaal (huuropbrengsten, dividend, rente, winst, waardevermeerdering, royalty’s enzovoort, en andere inkomsten die simpelweg voortkomen uit het feit dat men kapitaal bezit in de vorm van land, onroerend goed, geld, fabrieken enzovoort, ongeacht de precieze wettelijke classificatie daarvan).\n\n34\n\n29  \nDankzij de gegevens over erfenissen en vermogen kunnen we ook de ontwikkeling bestuderen van het relatieve belang van erfenissen en spaargeld in de opbouw van vermogen, en hun respectieve invloed op de dynamiek van de vermogensongelijkheid.\n\ngenerational wealth\n\n34\n\nwaar de bijzonder rijke historische bronnen ons een uniek zicht boden op de ontwikkeling van overgeërfde rijkdom op de lange termijn.30 Dit werk is deels uitgebreid naar andere landen, in het bijzonder naar Groot-Brittannië, Duitsland, Zweden en de vs. Die gegevens spelen een essentiële rol in dit onderzoek, omdat het gewicht van vermogensongelijkheid verschilt naargelang die voortkomt uit overgeërfde rijkdom of uit spaargeld dat in de loop van een leven is vergaard. In dit boek zullen we ons niet alleen bezighouden met het niveau van ongelijkheid als zodanig, maar ook en vooral met ongelijkheid als structureel verschijnsel, met andere woorden: de oorzaak van inkomensongelijkheid en vermogensongelijkheid tussen sociale groepen, en de verschillende economische, sociale, morele en politieke systemen die in het leven zijn geroepen om die te rechtvaardigen of te veroordelen. Ongelijkheid is op zich niet per se slecht: de centrale vraag luidt of die ongelijkheid gerechtvaardigd is, of daar redenen voor kunnen worden aangevoerd.\n\n36\n\naan deze zuiver technische aspecten voorbij kan gaan. Objectief gezien was het in de tijd van Kuznets, en eigenlijk tot en met de jaren tachtig, veel moeilijker grote hoeveelheden historische gegevens te verwerken dan tegenwoordig. We moeten wel bedenken dat toen Alice Hanson Jones in de jaren zeventig in de vs boedelbeschrijvingen van overledenen uit het koloniale tijdperk verzamelde,33 of toen Adeline Daumard hetzelfde deed voor Franse boedelregisters uit de negentiende eeuw,34 ze dat vooral met de hand moesten doen, met behulp van kartonnen systeemkaartjes.\n\ncurious to learn how they deal with selection bias when aggregating many such sources\n\n36\n\ndeel van de sterk verbeterde werkomstandigheden van de onderzoeker.36  \nDe voornaamste resultaten van dit onderzoek  \nTot welke belangrijke resultaten hebben deze tot nu toe niet-gepubliceerde historische gegevens geleid? Ten eerste moeten we concluderen dat je op je hoede moet zijn voor elk economisch determinisme ten aanzien van de verdeling van de rijkdom: de geschiedenis van de verdeling van de rijkdom heeft altijd een uitgesproken politiek karakter gehad en kan niet tot puur economische mechanismen worden herleid. Zo was de afname van de ongelijkheid in de ontwikkelde landen tussen 1910 en 1960 allereerst het gevolg van de beide wereldoorlogen en het politieke beleid dat daarna werd gevoerd om die schokken te boven te komen. Op dezelfde wijze kan de toename van de ongelijkheid waarvan we sinds de jaren tachtig weer getuige zijn, worden toegeschreven aan de politieke ommekeer in de afgelopen decennia, met name op het gebied van belasting en financiën. De geschiedenis van de ongelijkheid is afhankelijk van het beeld dat de economische, politieke en sociale actoren zich vormen van wat wel en niet rechtvaardig is, van de machtsverhoudingen tussen die actoren en van de collectieve keuzes die daaruit voortvloeien: de geschiedenis van de ongelijkheid is wat alle actoren er samen van maken.  \nDe tweede conclusie, die de kern van dit boek vormt, is dat de dynamiek van de verdeling van de rijkdom machtige mechanismen aan het licht brengt die afwisselend in de richting van convergentie (afnemende ongelijkheid) en divergentie (toenemende ongelijkheid) gaan, en dat er geen enkel natuurlijk en spontaan proces bestaat dat kan voorkomen dat destabiliserende en ongelijkheid bevorderende krachten blijvend de bovenhand krijgen.\n\n37\n\nDe belangrijkste convergerende kracht is de verspreiding van kennis en investering in opleiding en vaardigheden.\n\n38\n\n.  \nVanuit een zuiver theoretisch oogpunt bestaan er nog andere krachten die mogelijk een grotere gelijkheid kunnen bewerkstelligen. Je zou bijvoorbeeld kunnen denken dat de productietechnieken in de loop van de geschiedenis een steeds groter belang toekennen aan menselijke arbeid en competenties, in die mate dat het deel van het inkomen dat naar arbeid gaat groter wordt (en dat het deel dat naar het kapitaal gaat, navenant kleiner wordt).\n\ntot nu eigenlijk, want de intelligentie die nodig is voor technologie zal steeds meer vervanggen worden door kapitaal dat naar AI bedrijven gaat\n\n\n42\n\nlangzaam groeiende economieën neemt in het verleden vergaard vermogen natuurlijk een onevenredig belangrijke plaats in doordat er slechts een kleine stroom nieuw spaargeld nodig is om de omvang van het vermogen gestaag en substantieel te laten toenemen.\n\n.\n\n42\n\nonevenredig belangrijke plaats in doordat er slechts een kleine stroom nieuw spaargeld nodig is om de omvang van het vermogen gestaag en substantieel te laten toenemen.  \nDaar komt nog eens bij dat als het rendement op kapitaal over een langere periode significant hoger uitkomt dan het groeicijfer (wat niet vanzelf gaat, maar wel waarschijnlijker is als het groeicijfer laag is), er een zeer grote kans op een ongelijke verdeling van de rijkdom bestaat.  \nDeze fundamentele ongelijkheid die ik uitdruk in de formule r > g – waarin r voor rendement op kapitaal staat (het gemiddeld jaarlijkse rendement op kapitaal in de vorm van winst, dividend, rente, huuropbrengsten en andere inkomsten uit kapitaal, als percentage van de totale waarde), en waarin g staat voor de groei van de economie (de jaarlijkse groei van inkomens en productie) – zal een essentiële rol spelen in dit boek. In zekere zin vormt deze formule de logische samenvatting van dit werk.\n\n43\n\n.  \nDeze fundamentele divergerende kracht kan bovendien worden versterkt door bijkomende mechanismen: de spaarquote kan bijvoorbeeld sterk meestijgen met de groei van het kapitaal.\n\nr meer dan g: mensen wiens kapitaal snel stijgt, kunnen vaak meer van hun loon sparen (spaarquote)\n\n43\n\nhoe ‘perfecter’ de kapitaalmarkt is (in de betekenis die economen eraan geven), des te aannemelijker het wordt dat r groter is dan g.\n\nbijv belastingen, subsidies, wetten\n\n44\n\neen progressieve, mondiale belasting op vermogen.\n\nbeste oplossing voor r meer dan g\n\n45\n\nniveau van beurskapitalisatie – in verhouding tot het bbp of het nationaal inkomen\n\ntotale aandelenmarktkapitalisatie tov bbp ratio. beurskapitalisatie is aantal aandelen maal aandelenprijs\n\n50\n\n.  \nWaar het op neerkomt is dat het vak economie zich eigenlijk nooit had mogen losmaken van de andere sociale wetenschappen en dat het zich alleen maar in hun schoot kan ontwikkelen. De sociale wetenschappen als geheel weten te weinig om zo onderling verdeeld te zijn.\n\n55\n\nIn Kuznets’ eigen woorden: ‘This is perhaps 5 percent empirical information and 95 percent speculation, some of it possibly tainted by wishful thinking.’ Ibid., p. 24-26.\n\nOver de Kuznetscurve/klokcurve\n\n61\n\nDe vermogensongelijkheid – en het daaruit voortvloeiende inkomen uit kapitaal – is in feite altijd veel groter dan de inkomensongelijkheid uit arbeid.\n\n62\n\nVerder is het niet per se rechtvaardig om degenen die ervoor kiezen meer te sparen dan anderen hun beloning te ontzeggen – vooropgesteld dat verschillen in spaargedrag een belangrijke oorzaak van de vermogensongelijkheid zijn.\n\n63\n\nDe groei van het kapitaalaandeel steeg explosief na de verkiezing van Margaret Thatcher in Groot-Brittannië in 1979 en van Ronald Reagan in de Verenigde Staten in 1980, die het begin van een conservatieve omwenteling markeerden.\n\n65\n\nHet nationaal inkomen wordt gedefinieerd als de som van alle inkomens waar de inwoners van een bepaald land in een bepaald jaar over kunnen beschikken, ongeacht de juridische vorm van dat inkomen.\n\n66\n\nEen sleutelvraag in dit onderzoek is in hoeverre en onder welke omstandigheden een dergelijke situatie zich in de eenentwintigste eeuw opnieuw zou kunnen voordoen, mogelijk in een andere geografische configuratie, met Europa bijvoorbeeld eerder in de rol van overheerste dan overheerser. (Die angst is momenteel wijdverbreid in de Oude Wereld – misschien wel te wijdverbreid: we zullen zien.\n\ni feel this\n\n67\n\n:  \nNationaal inkomen = binnenlandse productie + netto inkomen uit het buitenland43  \nOp mondiaal niveau zijn de inkomsten die uit het buitenland worden ontvangen in evenwicht met de inkomsten die aan het buitenland worden betaald, zodat het mondiale inkomen per definitie gelijk is aan de mondiale productie:  \nMondiaal inkomen = mondiale productie44  \nDeze gelijkheid tussen de twee jaarlijkse stromen, inkomen en productie, is een abstracte boekhoudkundige zekerheid, maar zij geeft een belangrijke realiteit weer. Het totale inkomen in een bepaald jaar kan nooit hoger zijn dan de hoeveelheid nieuwe rijkdom die in dat jaar is geproduceerd (tenzij een land bij een ander land leent, maar op wereldschaal gaat dat niet). Omgekeerd moet alle productie worden verdeeld als inkomen in een of andere vorm: hetzij in de vorm van uitbetaalde lonen, salarissen, honoraria, bonussen enzovoort, aan werkenden en anderen die met hun arbeid aan het productieproces hebben bijgedragen (inkomen uit arbeid); of in de vorm van uitbetaalde winsten, dividenden, renten, huur, royalty’s enzovoort, aan de bezitters van het kapitaal dat in de productie is gebruikt (inkomen uit kapitaal).\n\n72\n\n/inkomen.  \nInkomen is een stroom. Het is gelijk aan de hoeveelheid goederen die in een bepaalde periode (meestal gaan we uit van een jaar) zijn geproduceerd en gedistribueerd.  \nKapitaal is een voorraad. Het is gelijk aan het totale vermogen dat op een bepaald moment in bezit is. Deze voorraad is afkomstig van het vermogen dat in alle voorafgaande jaren is toegeëigend of vergaard.\n\n73\n\nβ.  \nAls de totale kapitaalvoorraad van een land bijvoorbeeld gelijk is aan het equivalent van zes jaar nationaal inkomen, zeggen we dat β = 6 (of β = 600 procent).\n\n74\n\nEvenzo betekent een privévermogen van 180.000 euro, oftewel zes keer het gemiddelde nationaal jaarinkomen per hoofd, niet dat iedereen zoveel kapitaal bezit. Veel mensen hebben veel minder, terwijl sommigen miljoenen of tientallen miljoenen aan kapitaal hebben. Een groot deel van de bevolking bezit bijzonder weinig vermogen, aanzienlijk minder dan een jaarinkomen: een paar duizend euro op een bankrekening, het equivalent van enkele weken of maanden aan salaris. Sommige mensen hebben zelfs een negatief vermogen, met andere woorden: de goederen die ze bezitten zijn minder waard dan de schulden die ze hebben. Omgekeerd beschikken anderen over een aanzienlijk vermogen, variërend van tien tot twintig keer hun jaarinkomen of meer. De verhouding kapitaal/inkomen van een land als geheel vertelt ons niets over de ongelijkheid binnen dat land. Maar β is wel een graadmeter voor het algemene belang van kapitaal in een samenleving, zodat de analyse van deze verhouding een noodzakelijke eerste stap is voor de bestudering van ongelijkheid.\n\n74\n\nβ  \nNu kan ik de eerste hoofdwet van het kapitalisme presenteren, die de kapitaalvoorraad koppelt aan de inkomensstroom uit kapitaal. De verhouding kapitaal/inkomen β is heel eenvoudig gerelateerd aan het aandeel van het inkomen uit kapitaal in het nationaal inkomen, dat ik α noem. De formule luidt dan:  \nα = r x β\n\n77\n\nEen appartement van 100.000 euro kan een maandhuur van 400 euro oftewel bijna 5000 euro per jaar opbrengen (5 procent). Wie zo’n appartement bezit en er zelf in gaat wonen, hoeft een dergelijke huur niet te betalen en kan dat aldus bespaarde geld voor andere dingen gebruiken, wat eenzelfde rendement oplevert.\n\n78\n\nDat brengt ons bij de tweede hoofdwet van het kapitalisme: de verhouding kapitaal/inkomen (β) is hoger naarmate de spaarquote hoger is en de groei lager.\n\nintuitieve uitleg: hoge spaarquote . veel sparen van salaris . meer kapitaal . klein e stijging van salrissen\n\n78\n\nOp dit moment betekent de wet α = r x β eenvoudigweg dat ongeacht de economische, maatschappelijke en politieke krachten die de hoogte van de verhouding kapitaal/inkomen (β), het vermogensaandeel in het inkomen (α) en het rendement op vermogen (r) bepalen, deze drie variabelen niet onafhankelijk zijn van elkaar. Theoretisch gezien zijn er twee vrijheidsgraden, en geen drie.  \nNationale\n\n80\n\n.  \nPas in de periode tussen de twee wereldoorlogen werden de nationale rekeningen op een jaarlijkse basis gepresenteerd.\n\n81\n\nMet name de prijzen van onroerend goed en financiële activa waren dusdanig gekelderd dat het privévermogen leek te zijn verdampt. Van 1950 tot 1970, tijdens de wederopbouw, streefde men er vooral naar de opmerkelijke groei in de verschillende industrietakken te meten.\n\nmaw:  \nhuidige eeuwigstijgende huizenprijzen is slechts ons referentiekader en grotendeels toe te dichten aan de naschokken van ww2\n\n82\n\nNationale rekeningen zijn maatschappelijke constructies die zich voortdurend ontwikkelen en altijd de voornaamste aandachtsgebieden weerspiegelen van het tijdperk waarin ze zijn opgesteld.\n\n83\n\n1.2).  \nMet andere woorden: door hun leidende positie tijdens de industriële revolutie hebben Europa en Amerika beslag kunnen leggen op een aandeel van de mondiale productie dat twee tot drie keer groter was dan hun aandeel in de wereldbevolking, doordat de productie per hoofd van de bevolking simpelweg twee tot drie keer groter was dan het mondiale gemiddelde.58 Alles wijst erop dat deze fase van divergentie in de productie per hoofd van de bevolking achter de rug is en dat we nu aan een fase van convergentie zijn begonnen. Het ‘inhaalfenomeen’ dat daarvan het gevolg is, is echter nog lang niet voorbij (zie figuur 1.3). Het is veel te vroeg om te kunnen voorspellen wanneer dat zal eindigen, ook omdat de mogelijkheid van een economische en/of politieke ommekeer in China en elders niet kan worden uitgesloten.\n\nIMPORTANT GRAPHS\n\n85\n\nDaarbij moet worden aangetekend dat ze een niet te verwaarlozen foutmarge kunnen bevatten: het is altijd veel lastiger om de ongelijkheden tussen landen (of tussen verschillende perioden) te meten dan die binnen een bepaald land.  \nDe\n\nook omdat elk cbs waarschijnlijk iets anders meet?\n\n86\n\nWe vergelijken met andere woorden de diverse bbp’s op basis van de koopkracht die ze effectief voor hun inwoners hebben, omdat die hun geld over het algemeen in hun eigen land uitgeven, en niet in het buitenland.\n\n88\n\nOngeacht de gebruikte meetmethode lijkt een fase te zijn aangebroken waarin het inkomen van de rijke en arme landen naar elkaar toe groeit: convergentie.\n\n91\n\nAls rijke landen eenmaal in de armere buurlanden hebben geïnvesteerd, is het heel goed mogelijk dat ze die landen permanent in bezit houden en dat hun bezit uiteindelijk gigantische vormen aanneemt, zodat het nationaal inkomen per hoofd van de rijke landen altijd groter blijft dan dat van de armere landen, die voortdurend een groot deel van wat hun ingezetenen produceren aan buitenlanders moeten blijven betalen (zoals de Afrikanen al decennialang doen).\n\npost colonialism\n\n91\n\nGeen van de Aziatische landen die een inhaalslag ten opzichte van de meest ontwikkelde landen hebben gemaakt, heeft geprofiteerd van grootschalige buitenlandse investeringen, of het nu om Japan, Zuid-Korea of Taiwan gaat, of meer recent om China.\n\n92\n\nautarkie\n\nau·tar·k ie de v bn : autarkisch zelfst nw het vermogen geheel in de eigen economische behoeften te voorzien, economische onafhankelijkheid\n\n92\n\nMet andere woorden: de armen halen de rijken in voor zover ze hetzelfde niveau van technische kennis, kunde en onderwijs weten te bereiken, en niet door het eigendom van de rijken te worden.",

(page 10)\n- intro \n\n> The courage to be is rooted in the God who appears when God has disappeared in the anxiety of doubt. (190) (page 11)\n- my kierkegaard leap of faith \n\n> The courage to be, in the face of existentialism with its temptations to cynical despair and noncreative self-indulgence, is “the courage to accept oneself as accepted in spite of being unacceptable…. (page 13)  \n\n> The world is no longer the same place, and it never will be. It is for us to remember that those to whom we look in the past were in fact looking ahead. (page 18)  \n\n> We would like to make a life and not just a living, which—as we know from our own experience and that of others—takes courage. (page 20)  \n\n> Courage as a human act, as a matter of valuation, is an ethical concept.  (page 22)\n- to me courage means doing the right thing when its hard to d the right thing \n\n> When the aristocratic tradition disintegrated and courage could be defined as the universal knowledge of what is good and evil, wisdom and courage converged and true courage became distinguished from the soldier’s courage. The courage of the dying Socrates was rational-democratic, not heroic-aristocratic. (page 23)\n- it appears that what tillich calls ontologgical courage is abt knowing whats right while ethical courage is about doing whats righf in spite of some hardship \n\n> It is obvious that the terms Mut and courage directly introduce the ontological question, while Tapferkeit and fortitude in their present meanings are without such connotations.  (page 24)  \n\n> Christianity had a common basis with the religious syncretism of the ancient world, that is the idea of the descent of a divine being for the salvation of the world. In the religious movements which centered around this idea the anxiety of fate and death was conquered by man’s participation in the divine being who had taken fate and death upon himself. Christianity, although adhering to a similar faith, was superior to syncretism in the individual character of the Savior Jesus Christ and in its concrete-historical basis in the Old Testament. Therefore Christianity could assimilate many elements of the religious-philosophical syncretism of the later ancient world without losing its historical foundation; but it could not assimilate the genuine Stoic attitude. (page 26)  \n\n> The anxiety of fate and death controls the lives even of those who have lost the will to live. This shows that the Stoic recommendation of suicide is not directed to those who are conquered by life but to those who have conquered life, are able both to live and to die, and can choose freely between them. Suicide as an escape, dictated by fear, contradicts the Stoic courage to be. (page 27)\n- suicide is only a solution for those who have conquered life. \n\n> One cannot remove anxiety by arguing it away. This is not a recent psychoanalytical discovery; the Stoics, when glorifying reason, knew it as well. They knew that anxiety can be overcome only through the power of universal reason which prevails in the wise man over desires and fears. (page 28)\n- on anxiety. \n\n> The Stoics developed a profound doctrine of anxiety which also reminds us of recent analyses. They discovered that the object of fear is fear itself. “Nothing,” says Seneca, “is terrible in things except fear itself.” And Epictetus says, “For it is not death or hardship that is a fearful thing, but the fear of death and hardship.”  (page 28)  \n\n> The affirmation of one’s essential being in spite of desires and anxieties creates joy. (page 29)  \n\n> implies, contradicts the nature of God. It is impossible for him to suffer, he is beyond it. The Stoic as a human being is able to suffer. But he need not let suffering conquer the center of his rational being. He can keep himself above it because it is a consequence of that which is not his essential being but is accidental in him. The distinction between “beyond” and “above” implies a value judgment. The wise man who courageously conquers desire, suffering, and anxiety “surpasses God himself.” He is above the God who by his natural perfection and blessedness is beyond all this. On the basis of such a valuation the courage of wisdom and resignation could be replaced by the courage of faith in salvation, that is by faith in a God who paradoxically participates in human suffering. But Stoicism itself can never make this step. (page 29)\n- Tillich hs a very interesting Pov on stoicism \n\n> But more revealing than such statements is the general attitude of superiority and complacency which characterizes the Stoic diatribai, their moral orations and public accusations. The Stoic cannot say, as Hamlet does, that “conscience” makes cowards of us all. He does not see the universal fall from essential rationality to existential foolishness as a matter of responsibility and as a problem of guilt. The courage to be for him is the courage to affirm oneself in spite of fate and death, but it is not the courage to affirm oneself in spite of sin and guilt. It could not have been different: for the courage to face one’s own guilt leads to the question of salvation instead of renunciation. (page 30)\n- speechless... wildly fascinating take. stoicism is directed very outwardly and does not help whe trying to tackle ones own guilt \n\n> Stoicism retired into the background when faith in cosmic salvation replaced the courage of cosmic renunciation. But it returned when the medieval system which was dominated by the problem of salvation began to disintegrate. And it became decisive again for an intellectual elite which rejected the way of salvation without however replacing it with the Stoic way of renunciation. (page 31)  \n\n> renunciation (page 32)\n- in the stpoc sense this refers to them renunciating pain as not owning them \n\n> the relation of self-affirmation and love toward others. For Spinoza the latter is an implication of the former. Since virtue and the power of self-affirmation are identical, and since “generosity” is the act of going out toward others in a benevolent affect, no conflict between self-affirmation and love can be thought of. This of course presupposes that self-affirmation is not only distinguished from but precisely the opposite of “selfishness” in the sense of a negative moral quality. Self-affirmation is the ontological opposite of the “reduction of being” by such affects as contradict one’s essential nature. Erich Fromm has fully expressed the idea that the right self-love and the right love of others are interdependent, and that selfishness and the abuse of others are equally interdependent. (page 33)\n- self affirmation $\\neq$ selfishness \n\n> They miss the meaning of ontological concepts. It is not the function of these concepts to describe the ontological nature of reality in terms of the subjective or the objective side of our ordinary experience. It is the function of an ontological concept to use some realm of experience to point to characteristics of being-itself which lie above the split between subjectivity and objectivity and which therefore cannot be expressed literally in terms taken from the subjective or the objective side. (page 35)\n- i find this hard to grasp. it seems hes saying that in the end the subjective is able to trascend into something beyond it. is this a religious assertion? \n\n> Certainly nonbeing is not a concept like others. It is the negation of every concept; but as such it is an inescapable content of thought and, as the history of thought has shown, the most important one after being-itself. (page 40)\n- on the paradoxical nature of nonbeing \n\n> Fear, as opposed to anxiety has a definite object (as most authors agree), which can be faced, analyzed, attacked, endured. (page 41)  \n\n> Contingently we are put into the whole web of causal relations. Contingently we are determined by them in every moment and thrown out by them in the last moment. (page 46)\n- on anxiety about spatial existence \n\n> In order to avoid the risk of asking and doubting he surrenders the right to ask and to doubt. He surrenders himself in order to save his spiritual life. He “escapes from his freedom” (Fromm) in order to escape the anxiety of meaninglessness. Now he is no longer lonely, not in existential doubt, not in despair. He “participates” and affirms by participation the contents of his spiritual life. (page 49)\n- function of religion, spiritual real estate \n\n> Fanaticism is the correlate to spiritual self-surrender: it shows the anxiety which it was supposed to conquer, by attacking with disproportionate violence those who disagree and who demonstrate by their disagreement elements in the spiritual life of the fanatic which he must suppress in himself. Because he must suppress them in himself he must suppress them in others. His anxiety forces him to persecute dissenters. The weakness of the fanatic is that those whom he fights have a secret hold upon him; and to this weakness he and his group finally succumb. (page 49)  \n\n> The anxiety of guilt shows the same complex characteristics as the anxiety about ontic and spiritual nonbeing. It is present in every moment of moral self-awareness and can drive us toward complete self-rejection, to the feeling of being condemned—not to an external punishment but to the despair of having lost our destiny. (page 50)\n- on freedom \n\n> Courageously he takes nonbeing into his moral self-affirmation. This can happen in two ways, according to the duality of the tragic and the personal in man’s situation, the first based on the contingencies of fate, the second on the responsibility of freedom. (page 51)\n- tragedy and purpose \n\n> The famous words of Paul about “sin as the sting of death” point to the immanence of the anxiety of guilt within the fear of death. And the threat of fate and death has always awakened and increased the consciousness of guilt. (page 51)\n- death instigates thoughts on did i do all i shouldve done \n\n> The simple call to duty can save from emptiness, while the disintegration of the moral consciousness is an almost irresistible basis for the attack of spiritual nonbeing. On the other hand, existential doubt can undermine moral self-affirmation by throwing into the abyss of skepticism not only every moral principle but the meaning of moral self-affirmation as such. In this case the doubt is felt as guilt, while at the same time guilt is undermined by doubt. (page 51)\n- undermining moral self affirmation itself  \n\n> The three types of anxiety are interwoven in such a way that one of them gives the predominant color but all of them participate in the coloring of the state of anxiety. All of them and their underlying unity are existential, i.e. they are implied in the existence of man as man, his finitude, and his estrangement. They are fulfilled in the situation of despair to which all of them contribute. Despair is an ultimate or “boundary-line” situation. One cannot go beyond it. Its nature is indicated in the etymology of the word despair: without hope. No way out into the future appears. Nonbeing is felt as absolutely victorious. But there is a limit to its victory; nonbeing is felt as victorious, and feeling presupposes being. Enough being is left to feel the irresistible power of nonbeing, (page 51)  \n\n> We are not always aware of our having to die, but in the light of the experience of our having to die our whole life is experienced differently. In the same way the anxiety which is despair is not always present. But the rare occasions in which it is present determine the interpretation of existence as a whole. (page 53)  \n\n> that all human life can be interpreted as a continuous attempt to avoid despair. And this attempt is mostly successful. Extreme situations are not reached frequently and perhaps they are never reached by some people. The purpose of an analysis of such a situation is not to record ordinary human experiences but to show extreme possibilities in the light of which the ordinary situations must be understood. We are not always aware of our having to die, but in the light of the experience of our having to die our whole life is experienced differently. In the same way the anxiety which is despair is not always present. But the rare occasions in which it is present determine the interpretation of existence as a whole. (page 53)\n- RECAP: ontic anxiety is about fate and death, spiritual anxiety is about freedom and guilt (towards self), moral anxiety i think is about behaviour towards others and isolation (i think?) \n\n> an expression of the anxiety produced by the basic social conflict of the disintegrating Middle Ages. (page 56)\n- we are not to worry about premature death or the wrath of god, but then what are we to care about? mark the start of the age of meaninglessness \n\n> The one type is the anxiety of annihilating narrowness, of the impossibility of escape and the horror of being trapped. The other is the anxiety of annihilating openness, of infinite, formless space into which one falls without a place to fall upon. (page 56)\n- ! useful for clinic \n\n> anxiety is the awareness of unsolved conflicts between structural elements of the personality, as for instance conflicts between unconscious drives and repressive norms, between different drives trying to dominate the center of the personality, between imaginary worlds and the experience of the real world, between trends toward greatness and perfection and the experience of one’s smallness and imperfection, between the desire to be accepted by other people or society or the universe and the experience of being rejected, between the will to be and the seemingly intolerable burden of being which evokes the open or hidden desire not to be. All these conflicts, whether unconscious, subconscious, or conscious, whether unadmitted or admitted, make themselves felt in sudden or lasting stages of anxiety. (page 57)\n- on psychodynamic sources of anxiety \n\n> Anxiety turns us toward courage, because the other alternative is despair. Courage resists despair by taking anxiety into itself. (page 58)\n- leading to inner confict and requiring full self affirmation (whic seems muc like self-acceptance in this context) \n\n> The difference between the neurotic and the healthy (although potentially neurotic) personality is the following: the neurotic personality, on the basis of his greater sensitivity to nonbeing and consequently of his pro-founder anxiety, has settled down to a fixed, though limited and unrealistic, self-affirmation. This is, so to speak, the castle to which he has retired and which he defends with all means of psychological resistance against attack, be it from the side of reality or from the side of the analyst. And this resistance is not without some instinctive wisdom. The neurotic is aware of the danger of a situation in which his unrealistic self-affirmation is broken down and no realistic self-affirmation takes its place. The danger is either that he will fall back into another and much better defended neurosis or that with the breakdown of his limited self-affirmation he will fall into an unlimited despair. (page 59)  \n\n> But if he is not able to take this anxiety into his self-affirmation his anxiety turns into neurosis. This is the explanation of the mass neuroses which usually appear at the end of an era (see the previous chapter about the three periods of anxiety in Western history). In such periods existential anxiety is mixed with neurotic anxiety to such a degree that historians and analysts are unable to draw the boundary lines sharply. When, for example, does the anxiety of condemnation which underlies asceticism become pathological? Is the anxiety about the demonic always neurotic or even psychotic? To what degree are present-day Existentialist descriptions of man’s predicament caused by neurotic anxiety? (page 60)\n- how medicine needs existential thought \n\n> But if one preaches ultimate courage to somebody who is pathologically fixed to a limited self-affirmation, the content of the preaching is either resisted compulsively or—even worse—is taken into the castle of self-defense as another implement for avoiding the encounter with reality. Much enthusiastic reaction to religious appeal must be considered with suspicion from the point of view of a realistic self-affirmation. Much courage to be, created by religion, is nothing else than the desire to limit one’s own being and to strengthen this limitation through the power of religion. And even if religion does not lead to or does not directly support pathological self-reduction, it can reduce the openness of man to reality, above all to the reality which is himself. In this way religion can protect and feed a potentially neurotic state. These dangers must be realized by the minister and met with the help of the physician and psychotherapist. (page 62)\n- the limits of religious self affirmation \n\n> Therefore the security of the neurotic is unrealistic. He fears what is not to be feared and he feels to be safe what is not safe. The anxiety which he is not able to take upon himself produces images having no basis in reality, but it recedes in the face of things which should be feared. That is, one avoids particular dangers, although they are hardly real, and suppresses the awareness of having to die although this is an ever-present reality. Misplaced fear is a consequence of the pathological form of the anxiety of fate and death. (page 63)\n- ie staying inside with something like agoraphobia \n\n> Moral self-discipline and habits will produce moral perfection although one remains aware that they cannot remove the imperfection which is implied in man’s existential situation, his estrangement from his true being. Neurotic anxiety does the same thing but in a limited, fixed, and unrealistic way. The anxiety of becoming guilty, the horror of feeling condemned, are so strong that they make responsible decisions and any kind of moral action almost impossible. But since decisions and actions cannot be avoided they are reduced to a minimum which, however, is considered absolutely perfect; and the sphere where they take place is defended against any provocation to transcend it.  (page 64)\n- neurotic anxiety is muc like what we would now call depression with all the feelings of guilt getting out of hand \n\n> Pathological anxiety, once established, is an object of medical healing. Existential anxiety is an object of priestly help. Neither the medical nor the priestly function is bound to its vocational representatives: the minister may be a healer and the psychotherapist a priest, and each human being may be both in relation to the “neighbor.” But the functions should not be confused and the representatives should not try to replace each other. The goal of both of them is helping men to reach full self-affirmation, to attain the courage to be. (page 65)\n- on the professionals as well as the neigbours role \n\n> Biological self-affirmation implies the acceptance of want, toil, insecurity, pain, possible destruction. Without this self-affirmation life could not be preserved or increased. The more vital strength a being has the more it is able to affirm itself in spite of the dangers announced by fear and anxiety. (page 65)\n- it appears hes saying that self affirmation means saying \"i  am also my fears and anxieties, i accept them as part of me\" \n\n> There can be no doubt that fear which is directed toward a definite object has the biological function of announcing threats of nonbeing and provoking measures of protection and resistance. But one must ask: Is the same true of anxiety? Our biological argument has used the term fear predominantly, the term anxiety only exceptionally. This was done intentionally. For, biologically speaking, anxiety is more destructive than protective. While fear can lead to measures that deal with the objects of fear, anxiety cannot do so because it has no objects. The fact, already referred to, that life tries to transform anxiety into fear shows that anxiety is biologically useless and cannot be explained in terms of life protection. It produces self-defying forms of behavior. Anxiety therefore by its very nature transcends the biological argument. (page 66)\n- anxiety is useless as it has no object",

(page 189)  \n\n> But is there anything that must be true of all life, wherever it is found, and whatever the basis of its chemistry? If forms of life exist whose chemistry is based on silicon rather than carbon, or ammonia rather than water, if creatures are discovered that boil to death at -100 degrees centigrade, if a form of life is found that is not based on chemistry at all but on electronic reverberating circuits, will there still be any general principle that is true of all life? Obviously I do not know but, if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamental principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities. (page 189)  \n\n> As soon as the primeval soup provided conditions in which molecules could make copies of themselves, the replicators themselves took over. For more than three thousand million years, DNA has been the only replicator worth talking about in the world. But it does not necessarily hold these monopoly rights for all time. Whenever conditions arise in which a new kind of replicator can make copies of itself, the new replicators will tend to take over, and start a new kind of evolution of their own. Once this new evolution begins, it will in no necessary sense be subservient to the old. (page 192)\n- memes took over from genes \n\n> Fecund (page 192)\n- (a.) Fruitful in children; prolific. \n\n> In what sense then are memes competing with each other? Should we expect them to be 'selfish' or 'ruthless', if they have no alleles? The answer is that we might, because there is a sense in which they must indulge in a kind of competition with each other. (page 195)  \n\n> Perhaps we could regard an organized church, with its architecture, rituals, laws, music, art, and written tradition, as a co-adapted stable set of mutually-assisting memes.

(page 198)\n- as in, a meme may continue to exist for the simple reason that it is a good replicator \n\n> development of the theory of memes may be, there is one serious point which I would like to emphasize once again. This is that when we look at the evolution of cultural traits and at their survival value, we must be clear whose survival we are talking about. Biologists, as we have seen, are accustomed to looking for advantages at the gene level (or the individual, the group, or the species level according to taste). What we have not previously considered is that a cultural trait may have evolved in the way that it has, simply because it is advantageous to itself. (page 198)\n- doesnt that undermine the entire field of evolutionary psychology? \n\n> It is possible that yet another unique quality of man is a capacity for genuine, disinterested, true altruism. I hope so, but I am not going to argue the case one way or the other, nor to speculate over its possible memic evolution. (page 199)\n- true altruism could evolve memetically \n\n> The point I am making now is that, even if we look on the dark side and assume that individual man is fundamentally selfish, our conscious foresight-our capacity to simulate the future in imagination-could save us from the worst selfish excesses of the blind replicators. We have at least the mental equipment to foster our long-term selfish interests rather than merely our short-term selfish interests. We can see the long-term benefits of participating in a 'conspiracy of doves', and we can sit down together to discuss ways of making the conspiracy work. We have the power to defy the selfish genes of our birth and, if necessary, the selfish memes of our indoctrination. We can even discuss ways of deliberately cultivating and nurturing pure, disinterested altruism- something that has no place in nature, something that has never existed before in the whole history of the world. We are built as gene machines and cultured as meme machines, but we have the power to turn against our creators. We, alone on earth, can rebel against the tyranny of the selfish replicators.

Unless at least one of the players is a really saintly sucker, too good for this world, the game is doomed to end in mutual defection with its paradoxically poor result for both players. But there is another version of the game. It is called the 'Iterated' or 'Repeated' Prisoner's Dilemma. The iterated game is more complicated, and in its complication lies hope. (page 203)\n- repeated prisoner's dilemma \n\n> The birds in Chapter 10 who removed ticks from each other's feathers were playing an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game. How is this so? It is important, you remember, for a bird to pull off his own ticks, but he cannot reach the top of his own head and needs a companion to do that for him. It would seem only fair that he should return the favour later. But this service costs a bird time and energy, albeit not much. If a bird can get away with cheating-with having his own ticks removed but then refusing to reciprocate-he gains all the benefits without paying the costs. Rank the outcomes, and you'll find that indeed we have a true game of Prisoner's Dilemma.  (page 204)\n- reciprocal altruism as repeated prisoners dilemma \n\n> Unlike the simple game, which is rather predictable in that defect is the only rational strategy, the iterated version offers plenty of strategic scope. In the simple game there are only two possible strategies, cooperate and defect. Iteration, however, allows lots of conceivable strategies, and it is by no means obvious which one is best. (page 204)  \n\n> Remember that the 'players' in the tournament were not humans but computer programs, preprogrammed strategies. Their human authors played the same role as genes programming bodies  (page 206)  \n\n> It seems pretty convincing that nice guys do well in this game. (page 208)\n- nice guys finish first in axelrds tournament \n\n> It is possible to be even more forgiving than Tit for Tat. Tit for Two Tats allows its opponents two defections in a row before it eventually retaliates. This might seem excessively saintly and magnanimous. Nevertheless Axelrod worked out that, if only somebody had submitted Tit for Two Tats, it would have won the tournament. This is because it is so good at avoiding runs of mutual recrimination. (page 208)  \n\n> The important characteristic of an evolutionarily stable strategy, you will remember from earlier chapters, is that it carries on doing well when it is already numerous in the population of strategies. To say that Tit for Tat, say, is an ESS, would be to say that Tit for Tat does well in a climate dominated by Tit for Tat. This could be seen as a special kind of 'robustness'. As evolutionists we are tempted to see it as the only kind of robustness that matters. Why does it matter so much? Because, in the world of Darwinism, winnings are not paid out as money; they are paid out as offspring. To a Darwinian, a successful strategy is one that has become numerous in the population of strategies. For a strategy to remain successful, it must do well specifically when it is numerous, that is in a climate dominated by copies of itself. (page 210)  \n\n> Axelrod took the 63 strategies and threw them again into the computer to make 'generation 1' of an evolutionary succession. In 'generation 1', therefore, the 'climate' consisted of an equal representation of all 63 strategies. At the end of generation 1, winnings to each strategy were paid out, not as 'money' or 'points', but as offsprings identical to their (asexual) parents. (page 211)\n- in lifes iterated prisoners dilemma prizes are paid out in offspring not in cash \n\n> So, although Tit for Tat may be only dubiously an ESS, it has a sort of higher-order stability. What can this mean? Surely, stable is stable. Well, here we are taking a longer view. Always Defect resists invasion for a long time. But if we wait long enough, perhaps thousands of years, Tit for Tat will eventually muster the numbers required to tip it over the knife-edge, and the population will flip. But the reverse will not happen. Always Defect, as we have seen, cannot benefit from clustering, and so does not enjoy this higher-order stability. (page 215)  \n\n> tinuing to cooperate, and treating their divorce, too, as nonzero sum. As if child welfare were not a sufficient reason, the fees of two lawyers will make a nasty dent in the family finances. So obviously a sensible and civilized couple begin by going together to see one lawyer, don't they? (page 216)\n- divorce lawyers and zero sum games \n\n> Many situations in real life are, as a matter of fact, equivalent to nonzero sum games. Nature often plays the role of 'banker', and individuals can therefore benefit from one another's success. They do not have to do down rivals in order to benefit themselves. Without departing from the fundamental laws of the selfish gene, we can see how cooperation and mutual assistance can flourish even in a basically selfish world. We can see how, in Axelrod's meaning of the term, nice guys may finish first. (page 219)  \n\n> -envious strategy could easily be programmed into a computer by a very nasty man. And vice versa. A strategy's niceness is recognized by its behaviour, not by its motives (for it has none) nor by the personality of its author (who has faded into the background by the time the program is running in the computer). A computer program can behave in a strategic manner, without being aware of its strategy or, indeed, of anything at all. (page 223)  \n\n> Combine this with that other Victorian myth, nature red in tooth and claw, (page 227)  \n\n> The Extended Phenotype! (page 228)  \n\n> The technical word Phenotype is used for the bodily manifestation of a gene, the effect that a gene, in comparison with its alleles, has on the body, via development. (page 229)  \n\n> There are such genes and they are called segregation distorters. They have a diabolical simplicity. When a segregation distorter arises by mutation, it will spread inexorably through the population at the expense of its allele. It is this that is known as meiotic drive. It will happen even if the effects on bodily welfare, and on the welfare of all the other genes in the body, are disastrous. (page 229)\n- meiotic drive, genes cheating themselves \n\n> The phenotypic effects of a gene are normally seen as all the effects that it has on the body in which it sits. This is the conventional definition. But we shall now see that the phenotypic effects of a gene need to be thought of as all the effects that it has on the world. (page 231)  \n\n> All that I am going to add is that the tools may reach outside the individual body wall. (page 231)  \n\n> effects' shows that such uneasiness is misplaced. We need to accept only that the change in snail shell is a fluke adaptation. If it is, it has to have come about by Darwinian selection of fluke genes. We have demonstrated that the phenotypic effects of a gene can extend, not only to inanimate objects like stones, but to 'other' living bodies too. (page 235)  \n\n> I suggest that the most important question to ask about any parasite is this. Are its genes transmitted to future generations via the same vehicles as the host's genes?  (page 236)\n- on motivations of parasites. Maybe this is how our bodies got to be so complex? Parasitic mergers? \n\n> Our own genes cooperate with one another, not because they are our own but because they share the same outlet- sperm or egg-into the future. If any genes of an organism, such as a human, could discover a way of spreading themselves that did not depend on the conventional sperm or egg route, they would take it and be less cooperative. This is because they would stand to gain by a different set of future outcomes from the other genes in the body. We've already seen examples of genes that bias meiosis in their own favour. Perhaps there are also genes that have broken out of the sperm/egg 'proper channels' altogether and pioneered a sideways route. (page 238)\n- genes work together in bodies bc they dont have better ways to replicate than through the bodys eggs and sperms \n\n> natural selection to favour their opportunism and improve it. As for the precise methods that they use, there is no reason why these should be any different from the machinations-all too predictable to a selfish gene/extended phenotype theorist-of viruses. (page 239)\n- rabies \n\n> dogs, they turn into restless wanderers, propagating the virus far afield. It has even been suggested that the well-known hydrophobic symptom encourages the dog to shake the wet foam from its mouth-and with it the virus. I do not know of any direct evidence that sexually transmitted diseases increase the libido of sufferers, but I conjecture that it would be worth looking into. Certainly at least one alleged aphrodisiac, Spanish Fly, is said to work by inducing an itch .. . and making people itch is just the kind of thing viruses are good at. (page 240)  \n\n> Parasites, too, don't have to live inside their hosts; their genes can express themselves in hosts at a distance. Cuckoo nestlings don't live inside robins or reed-warblers; they don't suck their blood or devour their tissues, yet we have no hesitation in labelling them as parasites. (page 241)  \n\n> Maybe selection hasn't yet had time to do its work. Perhaps cuckoos have only in recent centuries started parasitizing their present hosts, and will in a few centuries be forced to give them up and victimize other species. (page 242)  \n\n> 'The rabbit runs faster than the fox, because the rabbit is running for his life while the fox is only running for his dinner.' (page 243)  \n\n> Actually, in a sense they are acting in their own best interests: the whole point of the life/dinner principle is that they theoretically could resist manipulation but it would be too costly to do so. (page 243)  \n\n> My favourite character in Wilson's The Insect Societies is Monomorium santschii. This species, over evolutionary time, has lost its worker caste altogether. The host workers do everything for their parasites, even the most terrible task of all. At the behest of the invading parasite queen, they actually perform the deed of murdering their own mother. The usurper doesn't need to use her jaws. She uses mind-control. How she does it is a mystery; she probably employs a chemical, for ant nervous systems-are generally highly attuned to them. If her weapon is indeed chemical, then it is as insidious a drug as any known to science. For think what it accomplishes. It floods the brain of the worker ant, grabs the reins of her muscles, woos her from deeply ingrained duties and turns her against her own mother. (page 244)  \n\n> Vehicles don't replicate themselves; they work to propagate their replicators. Replicators don't behave, don't perceive the world, don't catch prey or run away from predators; they make vehicles that do all those things. (page 246)\n- vehicles and replicators \n\n> would evolve to become as one flesh. We mightn't even be able to tell that there ever had been two vehicles. (page 247)  \n\n> A bee-hive, when it swarms, appears to reproduce by broad-fronted budding, like a wolf pack. But if we look more carefully we find that, as far as the genes are concerned, their destiny is largely shared. The future of the genes in the swarm is, at least to a large extent, lodged in the ovaries of one queen. This is why-it is just another way of expressing the message of earlier chapters-the bee colony looks and behaves like a truly integrated single vehicle. (page 248)  \n\n> A gene in a splurge-weed cell stands to gain by promoting the reproduction of its cell. It does not necessarily stand to gain by promoting the reproduction of its 'individual' plant.  (page 255)\n- bottlenecked reproduction may be the only way to create individuals \n\n> Indeed I suspect that the essential, defining feature of an individual organism is that it is a unit that begins and ends with a single-celled bottleneck. If life cycles become bottlenecked, living material seems bound to become boxed into discrete, unitary organisms.  (page 256)  \n\n> With only a little imagination we can see the gene as sitting at the centre of a radiating web of extended phenotypic power. And an object in the world is the centre of a converging web of influences from many genes sitting in many organisms. The long reach of the gene knows no obvious boundaries. The whole world is criss-crossed with causal arrows joining genes to phenotypic effects, far and near. (page 257)",

Consciousness exists to help you do better.\n\n> The third major scientific response to mind/body metaphysics developed in tandem with cognitive psychology, but by the end of the last century it had grown to overshadow it. I am referring to an approach that is broadly termed ‘cognitive neuroscience’. It focuses on the hardware of the mind, and it arose with the development of a plethora of physiological techniques that make it possible for us to observe and measure the dynamics of the living brain directly. (page 17)\n- The rise of cognitive neuroscience (cogneu). \n\n> These techniques render the inner workings of the organ of the mind plainly visible – thereby realising the wildest empiricist dreams of the behaviourists without limiting the scope of psychology to stimuli and responses. (page 17)\n- In a way this is behaviourism but with the resolution of the black box increased. Still in-out, but with more advanced tools than just observing human behaviour. Like the *out* can now be different, e.g. MRI recordings. \n\n> At no point did my lecturers say anything about what it is like to comprehend speech or retrieve a memory, let alone why it feels like anything at all. (page 19)  \n\n> As it happens, the neurosurgical treatment of hallucinations and delusions was not abandoned for ethical reasons; it fell out of favour when it became apparent that equivalent therapeutic results could be obtained with less morbidity and mortality by using some drugs which first became widely available in the 1950s, namely ‘major tranquillisers’. What these drugs did, and modern ‘antipsychotics’ still do, was block the neurochemical dopamine at the terminals of a brain circuit known as the mesocortical-mesolimbic dopamine system (see Figure 2). Since this circuit is cut through by prefrontal leucotomy, (page 28)\n- Psychiatry didn't abandon neurosurgical treatment of psychosis for ethical reasons, but because antipsychotics did the same thing.  \n\n> Neurologists using dopamine stimulants for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease have long known that they must be careful not to push their patients into psychosis, like Sacks did; and the onset of unusually vivid dreams is often the first sign of this side effect. (page 28)  \n\n> Dreaming can occur independently of REM sleep and that the mesocortical-mesolimbic dopamine circuit is indeed the major driver of dreaming. (page 29)  \n\n> Anticholinergic drugs – acetylcholine blockers – are now widely known to cause excessive dreaming.28 (page 29)  \n\n> The crucial subsequent observations were that the neurons that constitute this circuit (the cell bodies of which are located in the ventral tegmental area) fire at maximum rates during dreaming sleep,25 and at the same time deliver dopamine in maximum quantities to their targets in the nucleus accumbens (see Figure 2). (page 29)\n- Dreaming is far from motivationally neutral and dreams are similar to hallucinations in their neurobiological footprint. \n- In a way, this supports Freud's assertion that dreams are about wish-fulfilment. \n\n## Psychoanalysis\n\n> ‘psychoanalysis’. Its fundamental assumption was that manifest (nowadays called ‘explicit’ or ‘declarative’) subjective phenomena have latent (nowadays called ‘implicit’ or ‘non-declarative’) causes. (page 32)\n\n> He observed that patients adopted a far-from-indifferent attitude to their inferred unconscious intentions; it appeared to be more a matter of being unwilling rather than unable to become aware of them. He called this tendency variously ‘resistance’, ‘censorship’, ‘defence’ and ‘repression’, and observed that it prevents emotional distress. This in turn revealed the pivotal role that feelings play in mental life, how they underpin all sorts of self-serving biases. (page 33)\n- psychoanalysis 2 \n\n> He concluded that what ultimately underpinned feelings were bodily needs; that human mental life, no less than that of animals, was driven by the biological imperatives to survive and reproduce. These imperatives, for Freud, provided the link between the feeling mind and the physical body. (page 33)  \n\n> This function was wish-fulfilment. (page 22)\n- The function of dreams in psychoanalysis was wish-fulfilment. \n\n---\n\n> profound amnesic syndrome, known as Korsakoff psychosis, the central feature of which is a dream-like state called confabulation. (page 37)  \n\n> Considering Mr S’s confabulations from the first-person perspective clearly reveals something new about them: the content of his misrememberings is tendentiously motivated. These are far from being random search errors. They contain a clear self-serving bias; they have the aim and purpose of recasting his anxiety-ridden situation into a reassuring, safe and familiar one. So, just as Freud inferred in the case of dreams, confabulations are motivated. The mental processes in confabulatory amnesia are wishful. But this fact becomes apparent only when the emotional context and personal meaning (experienced by Mr S alone) of dental implants (‘the implants work fine’) and cardiac pacemakers (‘it never misses a beat’) are taken into account – as a psychoanalyst would do. This is what neuropsychologists fail to see when they aim to be entirely objective; as Sacks put it, when they exclude the psyche. (page 41)  \n\n> These feelings are examples of what Panksepp calls ‘homeostatic affects’ – affects that regulate the vital needs of the body. Freud called them ‘drives’ – the source of his ‘psychical energy’, the ‘mainspring of the psychical mechanism’. Freud’s broad term for the part of the mind that performs these vital functions was the ‘id’: (page 45)\n- de driften \n\n> metapsychological notions into the languages of anatomy and physiology, so that we could integrate Freud’s approach into neuroscience. (page 46)\n- Freud took on the task of deriving laws and principles from just subjectivity. the task Solms sets out to do is integrate those metapsychological principles back into their biological substrate. \n\n> On theoretical grounds, he had become concerned that the general assumption that these children will be ‘vegetative’ might have become a self-fulfilling prophecy, caused not by the condition itself but rather by the fact that such patients were treated by most paediatricians and neurologists as if they were completely insensate. (page 48)  \n\n**Effect of decortication on animals:**\n> The post-operative behaviour of these animals cannot by any stretch of the definitions be described as ‘comatose’ or ‘vegetative’. Merker writes that they show ‘no gross abnormalities in behaviour that would allow a casual observer to identify them as impaired’. Antonio Damasio concurs: ‘Decorticated mammals exhibit a remarkable persistence of coherent, goal-oriented behaviour that is consistent with feelings and consciousness.’3 Neonatally decorticate rats, for example, stand, rear, climb, hang from bars and sleep with normal postures. They groom, play, swim, eat and defend themselves. Either sex is capable of mating successfully when paired with normal cage mates. When they grow up, the females show the essentials of maternal behaviour, which, though deficient in some respects, allow them to raise pups to maturity. (page 50)\n\n> In an extensive review of the varieties of what we call ‘consciousness’, neurologist Adam Zeman distinguished two principal meanings of the term: ‘consciousness as the waking state’ and ‘consciousness as experience’. (page 52)\n- This explains my confusion with the way  we use bewustzijn helder \n\n> Anton Coenen later elaborated: ‘Consciousness in the first meaning (consciousness as the waking state) is in this view a necessary condition for consciousness in the second sense (consciousness as experience or phenomenal consciousness).’ (page 52)  \n\n> Let me therefore put this point forcefully: if we are to accept that someone who seems to be conscious actually isn’t, we should require an extremely convincing argument. Merely raising philosophical doubt isn’t enough. We need very good grounds to think that the two sorts of consciousness have come apart in such people, as they seemingly never do in us. (page 54)\n- Only applies in this direction though, people who don't seem to be conscious might actually be locked in...\n\n> That is how the cortex became the organ of the mind – the mind construed as consciousness of memory images – and how the subcortical brain became mindless. It all boiled down to the notion that your ‘mind’ is entirely constituted by past experience, which leaves traces that are associated with one another to form concrete images and abstract ideas. The rest of you, the peripheral sensory-motor parts and the innate and subcortical parts, including the parts that transmit impressions from the interior of your body, were considered to be purely reflex. And so, odd as it seems, the philosophical distinction between your mind and your body came to coincide with the anatomical distinction between the cortex and the subcortex. (page 60)  \n\n> Not all mental activity is conscious and not all consciousness is cortical. (page 61)\n\n> Language really is a cortical function, (page 61)\n\n> ‘Phenomenal’ consciousness (e.g. simple seeing and hearing) and ‘reflective’ consciousness (knowing that you are seeing and hearing) (page 62)\n\n> Some leading neuroscientists of emotion, such as Joseph LeDoux, believe that feelings literally come into existence in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.36 On this view, the subcortical precursors of feelings are entirely unconscious until they are ‘labelled’ in conscious working memory.37 For these theorists, emotion is just another form of cognition – in fact a rather abstract, reflective form of cognition. But if they are right, then why do patients whose working memory is largely obliterated show so much emotion? Phineas Gage is only the most famous case in a substantial literature. What might reflective consciousness add to the picture, if the pre-reflective form of feeling is so vividly expressed in these patients’ behaviour? (page 64)\n- If emotion only become conscious and labelled when they arrive in the cortex, why do people without one show so many signs of experiencing emotions?\n\n> Nobody is disputing that the cortex is involved in conscious processing. What is unsupportable is the view that the conscious self is generated there. (page 66)  \n\n> The philosophical notion of a zombie is different from the Hollywood one: it is of an imaginary humanoid creature that acts in all respects as if it is conscious, and is therefore externally indistinguishable from a normal person, but it actually lacks the inner dimension of subjective experience. (page 67)\n- Useful for solving the problem of other minds \n\n> Do you have to be aware of what you are perceiving and learning in order to perceive and learn it? Common sense, perhaps, says yes. The empiricist philosophers said yes. But the answer is no. (page 68)  \n\n> We know only that the fibres which reach the cerebral cortex after their progression through [the subcortical] grey tissues still maintain some relationship to the periphery of the body, but they can no longer deliver an image which resembles it topologically. They contain the body periphery in the same way as […] a poem contains the alphabet, in a complete rearrangement, serving different purposes, with manifold links between the individual topological elements, whereby some of them may be rendered several times, others not at all. (page 68)\n- Freud on sensory processing \n\n> He identified five successive stages in the processing of information: ‘perception’, ‘perceptual trace’, ‘unconscious’, ‘preconscious’ and ‘conscious’ (see Figure 8). The crucial difference between the stages was not that the unconscious one was bodily and the preconscious one was mental, but rather that the preconscious kind of memory processing could be replayed in consciousness while the unconscious kind could not.6 In other words, only a part of the mind is conscious. (page 69)\n- How Freud got to his major realisation.\n\n> The brain performs a wide range of mental functions that do not enter consciousness. (page 70)  \n\n> Another well-known review by John Bargh and Tanya Chartrand summarises our current understanding under a more poetic title, ‘The unbearable automaticity of being’: (page 70)  \n\n> However, our modern recognition of the ubiquity of unconscious mental functioning was not based on Freud’s theories. It was arrived at entirely independently, on the basis of fresh neurological findings and experimental evidence. A turning point was the case of HM, which was published in 1957. As a result of surgical resection of his hippocampi (the part of the cortex responsible for encoding declarative memories, the part causing him to suffer epileptic seizures), he was completely unable to remember any events that occurred after the date of his operation. However, the neuropsychologists who investigated him repeatedly from then (1953) until his death in 2008 observed that his performances on psychometric tests improved dramatically over the years, showing clear practice effects. He learnt how to master the tests even though he had no conscious recollection of doing them. (page 71)  \n\n> He reported the case of an amnesic woman who shook his hand every day as if she had never met him before (like my patient, Mr S). Claparède decided to hide a drawing pin in his palm, to see if she would remain so eager to greet him after being pricked. Following this experience, she refused to shake his hand, even though she had no conscious recollection of the painful event. When asked why she refused, she offered only evasions, such as: ‘Does a lady not have the right to withhold her hand from a gentleman? (page 71)\n- Unconscious memory case \n\n> She could offer only tangential statements to explain her embarrassment, saying things like ‘That is some machine you’ve got there, Dr Sperry!’11 (page 72)  \n\n> The history of cognitive neuroscience is a graveyard of theories that tried to specify the function of consciousness. What they have in common is the assumption that its function is to ‘bind’ the multitude of information streams that are spread throughout the brain into the coherent whole that characterises our conscious experience. (page 73)\n- binding problem \n\n> Francis Crick and Christof Koch hypothesised that the synchrony of gamma oscillations in the cortex binds and stores the experiences – in other words, that the integration might happen in time rather than space. Rodolfo Llinas similarly suggested synchronisation of thalamocortical activity below 40Hz. And so on. (page 74)\n- Fascinating. the temporal aspect seems underappreciated. like frames in a video. Reminds me of that twitter guy from qualia research institute \n\n> None of these theories tells us why or how the binding of information – through association, oscillation, synchronisation, re-entry, massive integration and the like – should necessarily give rise to experience. Why, exactly, should the contents of a ‘global workspace’ for information processing be experienced consciously? Does not binding and storage and synchronisation and massive integration and so on occur also in unconscious processing of information? Computers generate global workspaces and massively integrate information all the time, when they are linked together by the internet. Why, then, should the internet not be conscious? (page 74)  \n\n> Apparently alone among mental functions, feeling is necessarily conscious. Who ever heard of a feeling that has no subjective quality? What would the point be of a feeling if you did not feel it? Even Freud accepted that feelings must be conscious: (page 75)  \n- In essence, his solution to the hard problem is: consciousness is feeling, feeling must be consciousness. \n\n> The extent to which the empiricist philosophers and their scientific heirs, the behaviourists and cognitive scientists, ignored feeling is astonishing. (page 77)\n\n> Feelings are real, and we know about them because they permeate our consciousness. They are, in fact, for the reasons I will now explain, the wellspring of sentient being – in a sense that seems to me barely metaphorical. From their origin in some of the most ancient strata of the brain, they irrigate the dead soil of unconscious representations and bring them to mental life. (page 79)\n^55c880\n- Gevoelens zijn centraal in het bewustzijn. Ze irrigeren als het ware de dode grond van de mentale representaties en brengen het mental tot leven. \n\n> I think that my submerged memories of these experiences explain why I made the career choices that I did. In general, though, **isn’t this often how our feelings seem to motivate us, somewhere below the threshold of our awareness?** It’s a commonplace of psychological explanation – a piece of Freudianism so thoroughly absorbed into ordinary common sense that few would think to object to it.  (page 80)\n- The pervasiveness of Freudianism\n\n## Properties of feelings (i.e., conscious affect)\n> The simplest forms of feeling – hunger, thirst, sleepiness, muscle fatigue, nausea, coldness, urinary urgency, the need to defecate and the like – might not seem like affects, but that is what they are. **What distinguishes affective states from other mental states is that they are hedonically valenced: they feel ‘good’ or ‘bad’.** This is how affective sensations such as hunger and thirst differ from sensory ones like vision and hearing. Sight and sound do not possess intrinsic value – but feeling does. (page 83)\n\n> Valence reflects the value system underwriting all biological life, namely that it is ‘good’ to survive and to reproduce and ‘bad’ not to do so. (page 84)\n- Love this. Very Damasioesque \n\n> What motivates each individual is not these biological values directly, of course, but rather the subjective feelings they give rise to – even if we have no inkling of what the underlying biological values are, and even if we do not intellectually endorse them. For example, we eat sweet things because they taste good, not because they tend to have high energy content, which is the biological reason why they taste good. **Affects tell long evolutionary stories of which we are completely unaware.** (page 84)  \n\n> Feelings make creatures like us do something necessary. In that sense, they are measures of demands for work. (page 84)\n- I hope he answers the question why we need them, though I think his answer would be that conscious entities need them, hence the question becomes: why do we need those? \n\n> Freud, you will recall, defined ‘drive’ as ‘a measure of the demand made upon the mind for work in consequence of its connection with the body’. Now you see how closely affects are tied to drives; they are their subjective manifestation. Affects are how we become aware of our drives; they tell us how well or badly things are going in relation to the specific needs they measure. (page 85)  \n- Affects are the subjective manifestation of Freud's drives (the *id*), meaning demands made by the body made upon the mind for work.\n\n> Philosophers are often exercised by the possibility of what they call ‘qualia inversion’. How do I know that the red I see is the same as the red you see?  (page 85)\n- It is not immediately obvious how qualia inversion would apply to affect, because the subjective phenomenon is entangled with its meaning. Anger feels like anger in large part for its negative valence. It is difficult to imagine anger feeling much different in terms of valence.\n\n> For now, I want to convince you that feelings are always conscious, without exception. That is not to say that all the need-regulating mechanisms in the brain are conscious, but that is my point: it makes a difference whether a need is felt or not. Your water-to-salt ratio may be sliding all the time, in the background, but when you feel it, you want to drink. You might objectively be in danger without noticing it, but when you feel it you look for ways to escape. (page 86)\n- Feelings are always conscious and they (are supposed to) compel you to act. That is not to say that all need-regulating mechanisms are conscious, because they aren't. But once they become conscious, there's a pressing need that requires conscious awareness.\n\n> Emotional needs, too, can be managed automatically, by means of behavioural stereotypes such as ‘instincts’ (inborn survival and reproductive strategies, which Freud placed at the centre of his conception of the unconscious mind). But *emotional needs are usually more difficult to satisfy than bodily ones*, for reasons I will explain later in this chapter. That is why the feelings they evoke are typically more sustained. *A feeling disappears from consciousness when the need it announces has been met.* (page 86)  \n\n> [!question] Why are emotional needs usually more difficult to satisfy than bodily ones? \n\n> The third thing to notice about feelings is that **felt needs are prioritised over unfelt ones**. (page 86)  \n\n### Law of Affect\n\n> You decide what to do and what not to do on the basis of the felt consequences of your actions. This is the **Law of Affect**. Voluntary behaviour, guided by affect, thereby bestows an enormous adaptive advantage over involuntary behaviour: it liberates us from the shackles of automaticity and enables us to survive in unpredicted situations. (page 87)\n- The ‘Law of Affect’: ‘If a behaviour is consistently accompanied by pleasure it will increase, and if it is consistently accompanied by unpleasure it will decrease.’ ([Safron, 2021, p. 211](zotero://select/library/items/ATN47AJX)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XFIFSGEP?page=3&annotation=SR5AHIGP))\n- [[Noumenal world]]\n### Feelings guide the conscious self in uncertain situations\n\n> The fact that voluntary behaviour must be conscious reveals **the deepest biological function of feeling: it guides our behaviour in conditions of uncertainty**. It enables us to determine in the heat of the moment whether one course of action is better or worse than another. *In the example of air hunger, the regulation of your blood gases becomes conscious when you don’t have a ready-made solution to maintain your physiologically viable bounds. In your rush to escape from the carbon-dioxide-filled room, for instance, how do you know where to turn? You have never been in this situation before (in any burning building, let alone this specific one) so you cannot possibly predict what to do. Now you must decide whether to go this way or that, up or down, etc. You make such decisions by feeling your way through the problem: the feeling of suffocation waxes or wanes, depending upon whether you are going the right way or not – that is, depending upon whether the availability of oxygen increases or decreases.* (page 87)  \n- Something that still bugs me about this is that my subjective experience feels like I have a very cognitive/conscious \"say\" in which need I prioritise. It does not feel like something that occurs at the level of my superior colliculi. Solms' theory seems quite unidirectional in this sense. Namely that there is some piece of innate pattern, or maybe a learned but procedural and unconscious cue, that determines which flavour of affective consciousness infuses and directs my cortex. It feels like there is also a lot of top-down regulation going on here, where I am able to say, no thank you, I'd rather focus on something else now. Not if I'm suffocating of course, but in most everyday feeling/reasoning situations. This \"I\" feels too complex for the midbrain decision triangle. It feels like this \"I\" is someplace less evolutionarily ancient. But then again, maybe that is exactly Solms' point. Maybe his point is that this is just my cortex-biased mind speaking. Because if Solms' says that consciousness is affective and brainstem-y in nature, then why does my \"I\" feel so capable of rational thought? \n\n> Natural selection determined these survival mechanisms, but once feelings evolved – that is, **the unique ability we have as complex organisms to register our own states – something utterly new appeared in the universe: subjective being**. (page 88)\n- A thermostat registers its own state as well, so does a bacterium. Organisms have always registered their own states, that is the very reason we exist. \n- I suspect that even bacteria have competing needs. How did they decide?\n- **Was there a ceiling in the level of complexity that an organism could achieve, that wasn't broken until some organism happened to develop the capacity for subjective being?** Or was it more of a gradual thing, where, as organisms evolved, they also happened to become more conscious. I am curious what Solms' view on this would be. I suspect he would believe in the former. Because if he believed consciousness arose gradually alongside complexity, it might follow that it is just a byproduct. \n\n> Accordingly, SEEKING is our ‘default’ emotion. When we are not in the grip of one of the other (‘task-related’) affects, our consciousness tends towards this generalised sense of interest in the world. (page 93)  \n\n> Thinking is ‘virtual’ action; the capacity to try things out in imagination; a capacity which, for obvious biological reasons, saves lives. (page 94)  \n\n> The imaginary form of experience called thinking. (page 95)  \n\n> Conscious thinking requires cortex. But the feelings that guide it do not. (page 95)  \n\n> **Urbach-Wiethe disease**, a rare genetic condition that results in bilateral calcification of the amygdala. She felt no fear. (page 96)\n\n> there is an unusually high incidence of Urbach-Wiethe disease in a remote corner of South Africa called Namaqualand, which happens to be near my birthplace. (The faulty gene was carried there by a German colonist and then concentrated in an isolated community. (page 96) \n\n> Most people seem to be born with some specific FEAR triggers. Can you imagine what would happen if each of us had to learn from experience what happens when you jump off a cliff or pick up a viper? That is why we are descended from ancestors who felt disinclined to try. Those who did try are not our ancestors because they left no offspring. We have every reason to be grateful for this inheritance. (page 97)\n- Where fear and anxiety come from. Good story to tell in clinical settings. \n\n> Many neurologically healthy people fear things without knowing why. (page 97)\n- Learned emotions e.g. fear conditioning, are subcortical memories. \n\n> However, as with all the other biological mechanisms that underwrite emotions, you don’t have to know this in any ‘declarative’ sense; conditioning just happens automatically. This is because FEAR conditioning does not require the involvement of the cortex. It can occur in early childhood, even before the hippocampus (the cortical structure responsible for laying down declarative long-term memories) has matured. For this reason, just like Claparède’s case, many neurologically healthy people fear things without knowing why. (page 97)  \n\n> ‘Gut feeling’ is what guides this choice, but feelings easily go unrecognised; so they are described cognitively by words like ‘guessing’. (page 98)  \n- Gut feeling is how we describe 'unconscious' or non-declarative memories. \n\n> ‘non-declarative’ memories (like emotional and procedural ones) are hard to forget, for the same reason that they’re unconscious: they entail less uncertainty (i.e. they are more generalisable) and are therefore less subject to contextual revision.” (page 98)\n\n> The panic is frequently combined with anger – ‘where is she?’ – which evokes another conflict, this time between PANIC/GRIEF and RAGE. The one emotion makes you want to keep your caregiver close to you, always and forever, whereas the other simultaneously makes you want to destroy her. Guilt, *a secondary emotion which inhibits RAGE*, is the typical learnt outcome. This is a good example of how secondary emotions (like guilt, shame, envy and jealousy) arise from conflictual situations. (page 99)\n\n> [!info] Why guilt is a secondary emotion\n> Guilt is considered a secondary emotion because it is typically derived from a combination of primary emotions and involves the complex processing of thoughts and feelings. While primary emotions, such as fear or anger, are immediate and arise from direct stimuli, secondary emotions require higher cognitive functions.\n> \n> In the case of guilt, it often emerges from the combination of sadness (due to recognising one’s fault or failure) and fear (of repercussions or disapproval), with an added layer of moral or ethical reasoning. The experience of guilt thereby involves reflecting on one’s actions in the context of societal or personal standards, which necessitates a more sophisticated level of emotional and cognitive processing than primary emotions do.\n> \n> **Moreover, secondary emotions such as guilt often arise in response to the interpretation of events, rather than the events themselves, indicating the significance of cognitive appraisal in their formation.**\n\n### Play\n> Children love to play. Empirically, however, the majority of play episodes end in tears. This provides an important clue as to what it is all about, biologically speaking; it is about finding the limits of what is socially tolerable and permissible. (page 102)\n\n> We humans engage in pretend play, in which the participants try out different social roles (e.g. Mother/Baby, Teacher/Pupil, Doctor/Patient, Cop/Robber, Cowboy/Indian,29 King of the Castle/Dirty Rascal – note the everpresent status and power hierarchies). We do not know what goes on in the imagination of other mammals while playing, but we may confidently hypothesise that they too are ‘trying out’ different social roles, and thereby learning what they can and can’t get away with. (page 102)\n\n> I hope you can now see that, while bodily affects have a certain vividness and immediacy which makes them seem in a sense unmissable, emotional affects operate through conscious feeling too. *Although we do not always recognise them for what they are, they regulate almost all our voluntary behaviour through their various inner spurs and spurts*. Voluntary behaviour consists essentially in the making of here-and-now choices. How can you make choices without them being grounded in some evaluative system that tells you which option is better or worse? It is these values that feeling contributes to behaviour. (page 104)  \n\n> All affects are homeostatic. (page 104)  \n\n> ‘reticulate’ (net-like) core of the brainstem. (page 105)\n- Reticular meaning reticular formation.\n\n> Most antidepressants – serotonin boosters – act on neurons whose cell bodies are located in a region of the reticular activating system called the raphe nuclei (see Figure 1). Serotonin is ‘sourced’ there, as we say. Antipsychotics – dopamine blockers – act on neurons sourced in another part of the reticular activating system: the ventral tegmental area (see Figure 2). The same applies to anti-anxiety drugs – many of which block a chemical called noradrenaline, which is produced by neurons sourced in the locus coeruleus complex (also Figure 1), yet another part of the reticular activating system. All these neurons are clumped together in the reticulate core of the brainstem. Psychiatrists wouldn’t tinker with this region of the brain if it merely switched consciousness on and off. If that were all it did, it would interest only anesthetists. The second view must therefore be wrong. (page 106)\n\n\n> **Lesion studies, deep brain stimulation, pharmacological manipulation and functional neuroimaging** all point to the same conclusion: the reticulate core of the brainstem generates affect. Apparently, therefore, the only part of the brain that we know to be necessary for arousing consciousness as a whole has an equally powerful influence over another mental function, namely feeling. In the previous chapter, I showed how feelings pervade conscious experience: whatever else it is meant to be doing, having and dealing with feelings (which come from within us and regulate our biological needs) appears to be one of the central tasks of consciousness. But it now looks as though the neurological sources of affect and of consciousness are, at a minimum, deeply entangled with one another, and they may in fact be the very same machinery. (page 107)  \n### Neuromodulation\n> What fewer people know is that synaptic transmission takes place under the constant influence of a completely different physiological process. This other type of neuronal activity is called post-synaptic modulation. (page 109)  \n\n> This distinction between ‘channel’ and ‘state’ is a useful shorthand for the two ways in which neurons communicate with each other.8 The state of the cortex affects the differential strengths of the message-passing that goes on within its channels; in a manner of speaking, the state adjusts how ‘loudly’ the different channels communicate (see Figure 11) (page 110)  \n\n> Synaptic transmission is binary (on/off, yes/no, 1/0) but post-synaptic neuromodulation grades the likelihood that a given set of neurons will fire. (page 111)\n\n> Some physiologists prefer the term ‘modulation’ over ‘arousal’. (page 111) \n- Arousal is a kind of post-synaptic neuromodulation.\n\n> Where do *neuromodulators* come from? They come from all over the body, including the pituitary, adrenal, thyroid and sex glands (which produce various hormones) and the hypothalamus (which produces innumerable peptides). But the central source of ‘arousal’ from the brain’s point of view is the *reticular activating system*. Reticular brainstem arousal releases the five best-known neuromodulators: dopamine (sourced mainly in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra), noradrenaline (sourced mainly in the locus coeruleus complex), acetylcholine (sourced mainly in the **mesopontine tegmentum** and basal forebrain nuclei), serotonin (sourced mainly in the raphe nuclei) and histamine (sourced mainly in the tuberomammillary hypothalamus) (page 112)  \n\n> The effect of all these modulators is determined by the presence or absence of the relevant receptors and receptor subtypes. In other words, **although neuromodulators are spread far and wide through the brain, they only influence cells that possess the relevant receptors**. Arousal must not be thought of as a crude or blunt process. It is highly multifaceted, and it unfolds over many dimensions, both spatially and temporally. The potential messages carried by neuromodulators float through the many networks of the brain, but (like painkillers) they are only made use of where they are needed. (page 112)\n- Neuroscience as a complexity science: \n\t- [[Cognitive-Science-as-Complexity-Science-FJFYGAEP]]\n\t- [[3 - Favela 2020 - Cognitive science as complexity science.pdf]]\n\t- [[Course Contents - Complex Systems]]. \n\n> [!summary] Summary\n> Synaptic transmission takes place under the influence of post-synaptic modulation. Post-synaptic modulation, unlike synaptic transmission, grades the likelihood with which a given set of neurons fire. Post-synaptic modulation works via *neuromodulators*, which may come from different glands (e.g., pituitary, adrenal, thyroid, sex glands, or the hypothalamus). The *reticular activating system* plays a central role in post-synaptic modulation. It regulates arousal by releasing five well-known neuromodulators: dopamine, noradrenaline, acetylcholine, serotonin, and histamine. \n> \n> These are made in specific nuclei:\n> - *Dopamine*: ventral tegmental area (midbrain), arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus;\n> - *Serotonin*: raphe nuclei (along the central brainstem axis);\n> - *Noradrenalin*: locus coerules (midbrain / pons).\n> - *Acetylcholine*: mesopontine tegmentum, nucleus basalis of Meynert in basal forebrain;\n> - *Histamine*: tuberomamillary hypothalamus.\n> \n> This may seem like a very course process, but it allows for fine-grained control because neurons only respond to neuromodulators if they possess the relevant receptors. \n\n> Further specificity is obtained by those modulators that are released not only by the brainstem (and endocrine system) but also in the neural circuits themselves. The five best-known modulators of arousal that I listed above are sourced mainly in the reticular brainstem. The hormones are sourced elsewhere in the body and reach the brain mainly via the bloodstream. *The more specific ones are the peptides, many of which are sourced in the hypothalamus. Each peptide does something different, again depending on the receptor type and site.* (page 113)  \n- The hypothalamus makes numerous peptides that act as neuromodulators. \n\n> So far in this chapter I have addressed two questions: where does arousal come from anatomically and how does it arise physiologically? The answers are that it is generated mainly, but not exclusively, in the brainstem and hypothalamus, and it arouses the forebrain by modulating neurotransmission. (page 113)  \n- Arousal is generated mainly in the brainstem and hypothalamus, and it arouses the forebrain by modulating neurotransmission.\n\n## Periaquaductal gray (PAG)\n> Why arousal is generated is that it responds to endogenous demands made upon the mind to perform work. These demands take the form of a multiplicity of ‘error’ signals that converge on the core of the brain. Most such signals are dealt with automatically and unconsciously, and demand conscious responses only in situations where automatic responses cannot suffice. (page 113)  \n\n> The shift from vegetative wakefulness to affective arousal appears to depend upon the integrity of a small, tightly packed knot of neurons surrounding the central canal of the midbrain, – the periaqueductal grey (PAG), where all the brain’s affective circuitry converges (page 114)\n\n> Affective arousal enables volition. (page 114)\n- volition is intentional behaviour\n\n> The state just described is the ‘vegetative state’. The main difference between it and coma is preservation of wakefulness. But the circadian sleep/wake cycle is just another autonomic function.12 That is why the vegetative state is also called ‘unresponsive wakefulness’ (page 114)\n\n> The PAG is conceptualised as the terminus of the ‘descending’ network for affect, to be contrasted with the ‘ascending’ and ‘modulatory’ affect networks of the brainstem’s body-monitoring nuclei and reticular activating system. This means that the PAG is the main output centre of all the affective circuits, channelling information to the musculoskeletal and visceral effectors that generate ‘emotion proper’. (page 115)\n- 'Emotion proper' refers to the actual physical manifestation or expression of an emotion, i.e., the concrete bodily changes but also the experience of having the emotion. \n- So the PAG takes processed emotional information that comes from cortical areas of the brain (e.g., threat has been detected in peripheral vision), and turns it into (a) a felt emotion, (2) action patterns. \n\n> The PAG is the *final common path to affective output*. It must, therefore, in a word, ‘choose’ what is to be done next, once the various affective circuits and their associated conditioned behaviours have made their contributions to action. It must make these choices by evaluating the residual error signals that are relayed to it by the affect systems. It must judge their competing bids by the ultimate biological imperatives to survive and reproduce, with each error signal communicating its component need to it. In short, the PAG must set priorities for the next action sequence. (page 116)  \n\n> [!note] The PAG in action!\n> Imagine you're hiking and suddenly you encounter a bear. Multiple affect systems activate simultaneously:\n> \n> 1. **FEAR system:**\n> - Error signal: \"Immediate survival threat!\"\n> - Proposed action: Freeze or run\n> - High priority signal to PAG\n> 2. **SEEKING system:**\n> - Error signal: \"Need to reach hiking destination\"\n> - Proposed action: Continue walking forward\n> - Lower priority signal to PAG\n> 3. **Social system:**\n> - Error signal: \"Don't want to look cowardly in front of hiking companions\"\n> - Proposed action: Stay calm and collected\n> - Medium priority signal to PAG\n> \n> The PAG receives all these competing signals and must \"choose\" based on survival imperatives. In this case, *it would likely prioritize the FEAR signal as it relates directly to immediate survival*.\n> \n> The output would be a coordinated response:\n> - Freezing behavior\n> - Increased heart rate\n> - Stress hormone release\n> - Suppressed digestion\n> - Heightened sensory awareness\n>\n> The other impulses (reaching destination, maintaining social status) are temporarily suppressed because the survival-related error signal takes precedence in the PAG's \"decision-making.\"\n> \n> This shows how the PAG acts as an arbitrator, weighing different affect systems' signals against core biological imperatives to generate the most adaptive response.\n\n### The PAG's inputs\n> After the cortex and other forebrain structures have performed their cognitive work – after they have submitted their contributions to action – the final decision about ‘what to do next’ is made at the level of the midbrain. Such decisions take the form of affective feelings, generated by the PAG, which can override any cognitive strategies formulated during the previous action sequence. In every moment, the PAG chooses the affect that will determine and modulate the next sequence. (page 117)  \n- The PAG generates affective feelings;\n- Affective feelings override any cognitive strategies formulated previously. \n- Monitors the \"subjective\" body state; receiving all competing signals from the cortex.\n\n> The superior colliculi thus represent in distilled form the moment-by-moment state of the objective (sensory and motor) body, in much the same way as the PAG monitors its subjective (need) state. (page 118)  \n- The superior colliculi monitor the \"objective\" body state; its position in space and its surroundings (mostly visual). \n\n> Midbrain decisions about what to do next are therefore based upon feedback from the brain’s affective circuits together with its sensory-motor maps, each of which updates us on different aspects of ‘where things stand now’. (page 118)\n\n> [!question] Why are the *superior colliculi* necessary in addition to the cortical competing needs, which also rely on sensorimotor data?\n> I suppose the sensorimotor data that the cortical competing needs base themselves on are more extensive, having gone through several associative areas and cortical processing), but they may also be dated. E.g., when a bear attacks you, you don't want to be waiting for the cortex telling you to run, if the signal has sufficiently low uncertainty and sufficiently high priority, you just want to be running.\n> \n> In other words, the superior colliculi provide a \"fast track\" of current sensorimotor information that bypasses the slower, more detailed cortical processing. You can think of it like a slow but sophisticated GPS system (cortical processing) and a quick-reacting collision detector (superior colliculi).\n\n> Perceptual consciousness of the world around us becomes possible with the help of suitably aroused cortex, which (unlike affective consciousness) is what hydranencephalic children and decorticate animals lack. The superior colliculi provide condensed here-and-now mappings of potential targets and actions, but the cortex provides the detailed ‘representations’ that we use to guide each action sequence as it unfolds. In addition to these highly differentiated images, there are in the subcortical forebrain many unconscious action programmes which are called **‘procedures’ and ‘responses’ – not images**. (Think, for example, of the automatised kinds of memory you rely upon to ride a bike, or to navigate the route to a familiar location.) **These are encoded primarily in the subcortical basal ganglia, amygdala and cerebellum**. *Memories are not mere records of the past. Biologically speaking, they are about the past but they are for the future. They are, all of them, in their essence, predictions aimed at meeting our needs.* I will take up this important point in the chapters which follow. (page 119)  \n- Memories are not mere records of the past. Biologically speaking, they are about the past but they are for the future. They are, all of them, in their essence, predictions aimed at meeting our needs.\n## Predictive coding\n> Recall that long-term memories serve the future. Once the midbrain decision triangle has evaluated the compressed feedback flowing in from each previous action, what it activates is an expanded feedforward process which unfolds in the reverse direction, through the forebrain’s memory systems, generating an expected context for the selected motor sequence. This is the product of all our learning. In other words, when a need propels us into the world, we do not discover that world afresh with each new cycle. It activates a set of predictions about the likely sensory consequences of our actions, based upon our past experience of how to meet the selected need in the prevailing circumstances. (page 120)  \n- The midbrain decision triangle received cortical feedback from each previous action.\n- It then chooses the next motor sequence, and requests the forebrain's memory systems to generate an expected context for it. \n\n> The mental process that controls voluntary behaviour: ‘predicting the present’. (page 120)  \n- We always start with 'predicting the present', then we test our predictions against reality.\n\n> Stereotyped responses are thereby supplemented by a more flexible repertoire of options. (page 120)\n- Motor responses start as procedural action sequences stored in the basal ganglia, and unfold upwards to representational 'memory images'. \n\n> [The cortex] generates what Merker calls a ‘fully articulated, panoramic, three-dimensional world composed of shaped solid objects: the world of our familiar phenomenal experience’. (page 120)\n\n> [!important] Mindblowing\n> \"Most people don’t realise that our here-and-now perceptions are constantly guided by predictions, generated mainly from long-term memory. But they are. *That is why far fewer neurons propagate signals from the external sense organs to the internal memory systems than the other way round*. For example, the ratio of incoming connections to outgoing ones in the lateral geniculate body (which relays information from the eyes to the visual cortex and vice-versa; see Figure 6) is about **1:10**. *The heavy lifting is done by the predictive signals that meet the sensory ones arriving from the periphery*. This saves an enormous amount of information processing and therefore metabolic work. Considering that the brain consumes about 20 per cent of our total energy supplies, this is a valuable efficiency. *Why treat everything in the world as if you’d never encountered it before?* Instead, what the brain does is **propagate inwards only that portion of the incoming information which does not match its expectations**. That is why perception is nowadays sometimes described as ‘fantasy’ and ‘controlled hallucination’; it begins with an expected scenario which is then adjusted to match the incoming signal.41 In this sense, the classical anatomists were right: cortical processing consists mainly in the activation of ‘memory images’, suitably rearranged to predict the next cycle of perception and action.\" (page 121)\n\n==PROCESSED UNTIL HERE==\n\n> What appear in consciousness are not the raw sensory signals transmitted from the periphery, but rather predictive inferences derived from memory traces of such signals and their consequences. The fact that feeling is spread, as it were, over stabilised cortical inferences to create what I call ‘mental solids’47 – the external world as it manifests in perception – partly accounts for the different phenomenal qualities of affect versus conscious perception. (page 122)\n- Not feelings of the world, but feelings about predictions based on memories elicited by the world \n\n> Panksepp suggests that an evolutionary bridge between these two aspects of experience could have been forged by the ‘sensory affects’ (e.g. pain, disgust and surprise). Sensory affects are simultaneously internal feelings and external perceptions; they are inherently valenced perceptions qualified by specific feelings. So, for example, pain feels different from disgust, and you respond to them differently, withdrawing or retching, depending on which one you have. Over this evolutionary bridge, in Panksepp’s view, consciousness became extended onto perception in general, since it contextualises affect. After all, the external world acquires value for us only because we must meet our needs there; it acquires value in relation to affect. (page 122)\n- he suggests that conscious exteroception (sensing / representations) first arose from the need to contextualise sensory affect like pain or disgust, extending consciousness to representations \n\n> So, my answer to the question of why perception, action and cognition are ever felt at all is that they are felt because they contextualise affect. It’s as if our perceptual experience says: ‘I feel like this about that.’ (page 122)  \n\n> am talking only about conscious perception here. It is a small step from there to infer that our five modalities of perceptual consciousness (sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell)45 evolved to qualify the different categories of external information that are registered by our sensory organs,46 just as the seven varieties of affective consciousness discussed in the previous chapter qualify the different categories of emotional need in mammals. (page 122)\n- he is saying that conscious perception is some ind of affect? \n\n> The predictions themselves are furnished by the forebrain’s long-term memory networks, which filter the present through the lens of the past. (page 123)  \n\n> That’s what the midbrain decision triangle does when it selects which signals to boost; it modulates signal strength via the reticular activating system. (page 123)\n- the  midbrain triangle \"chooses\" between basal ganglia and cortical action patterns? Midbrain = reticular activating system, which modulates neuronal activity \n\n> If your smoke alarm goes off but nothing appears to be burning, either the alarm or the appearances must be at fault, and somehow a verdict must be rendered on the disagreement. That is what happens in the midbrain decision triangle: the competing claims are assessed and a winner is declared. The outcome of this process is conveyed to the forebrain by the reticular activating system, which acts on the basis of your expectations and then – as the selected action unfolds – releases clouds of neuromodulating molecules to fine-tune the signals in your long-term memory networks, up-regulating the forebrain channels in which some predictions are stored and down-regulating others. This, in turn, leads to learning from experience. In this way, we keep improving our generative model of the world, by trial and error. (page 123)  \n\n> Accordingly, things feel good or bad: increasing confidence (in a prediction) is good, decreasing confidence is bad. So, we try to minimise uncertainty in our expectations. (page 124)  \n\n> perception and action are an ongoing process of hypothesis-testing, in which the brain constantly tries to suppress error signals and confirm its hypotheses. (Experimental science itself is just a systematised version of this everyday process, as we saw in Chapter 1: ‘if hypothesis X is correct, then Y should happen when I do Z’. (page 124)  \n\n> Feeling thus remains the common factor in all consciousness, both affective and cognitive. Its function is to evaluate the success or failure of your action programmes and their associated contexts. (page 124)\n- function of feeling \n\n> Unlike other bodily organs, the brain is structurally hierarchical. It is layered somewhat like an archaeological site, with the older levels covered over by the newer ones. Hence the title of this book: The Hidden Spring. The deepest core of the brainstem contains the most ancient structures, in evolutionary terms, and the highest levels of the cortex contain the most recent ones. This does not mean that the lower (and older) structures are less important than the higher (newer) ones. On the contrary, functionally speaking, the highest forebrain structures are merely elaborations of the lowest brainstem ones. (page 125)  \n\n> Friston explains that biological systems such as cells must have emerged through complex versions of the same process that formed simpler ‘self-organising’ systems such as crystals from liquid, because they share a common mechanism. This mechanism, he says, is ‘free energy minimisation’ (which I will explain shortly). All self-organising systems, including you and me, have one fundamental task in common: to keep existing. Friston believes that we achieve this task by minimising our free energy. (page 127)  \n\n> Despite Friston’s towering reputation, for many years I took only a distant interest in his work. Then, in 2010, he published a paper with a young psychopharmacologist named Robin Carhart-Harris, whom I knew slightly from his interest in neuropsychoanalysis. His paper with Friston argued that Freud’s conception of drive energy (i.e. ‘psychical energy’) was consistent with the Free Energy Principle. (page 128)\n- READ \n\n> Every homeostat consists in just three components: a receptor (which measures temperature, in my model example), a control centre (which determines how to maintain temperature within the viable bounds: 36.5–37.5°C, in my example) and an effector (which performs the work required to return you to those bounds when you exceed them). (page 129)\n- #to/anki \n\n> Homeostasis runs in the opposite direction. It resists entropy. It ensures that you occupy a limited range of states. That is how it maintains your required temperature, and how it keeps you alive – how it prevents you from dissipating. Living things must resist one of the fundamental principles of physics: the Second Law of Thermodynamics. (page 131)\n- #to/anki \n\n> Entropy may in fact be the physical basis for the fact that time itself appears to have a direction and a flow. (page 131)\n- time may flow forward bc of the second law of thermodynamics \n\n> The example that is conventionally used by physicists to illustrate these concepts involves a compressed gas being introduced into an empty, larger chamber through a small aperture. As the molecules move randomly, they explore the chamber, spreading out to occupy the available space. The more time passes, the more locations there are in which each molecule might be found. The only way this process can be reversed – the only way to gather the gas back into its original container – is with work. (page 132)  \n\n> the microstate of a system (i.e. the state of each and every molecule) (page 133)  \n\n> The relationship between entropy and information was formalised in a famous equation by the electrical engineer and mathematician Claude Shannon. With this breakthrough, Shannon single-handedly incorporated ‘information’ into physics, where it has since become a basic concept, especially in quantum mechanics.25 On the basis of Shannon’s work, the physicist Edwin Thompson Jaynes argued that thermodynamic entropy should be seen as an application of information entropy.26 Shannon’s definition is therefore more fundamental than the thermodynamic one: an abstract definition of entropy in terms of information dynamics is more generally applicable than a concrete one in terms of heat dynamics. The laws of thermodynamics could therefore be seen as a special case of the deeper laws of probability. (page 133)\n- on information being central to entropy \n\n> This is important because thermodynamic laws apply only to material (tangible, visible) systems, such as brains, while information laws apply also to immaterial (intangible, invisible) systems, such as minds. (page 134)\n- #to/anki \n\n> These are heady issues. Before I go on, let’s pause to take stock. I have conveyed three important points. The first is that the average information of a system is the entropy of that system (i.e. the entropy in a system is a measure of the amount of information needed to describe its physical state). The second is that living systems must resist entropy. These two facts together imply that we must minimise the information that we process. (Here I mean information in Shannon’s sense, of course; in other words, we must minimise our uncertainty.) Everything else I am going to say in this chapter, and the next two, follows from this simple but startling conclusion. (page 135)\n- #to/anki \n\n> we living systems resist entropy through the mechanism of homeostasis. In short, we receive information about our likely survival by asking questions (i.e. taking measurements) of our biological state in relation to unfolding events. The more uncertain the answers are (i.e. the more information they contain) the worse for us; it means we are failing in our homeostatic obligation to occupy limited states (our expected states). (page 135)  \n\n> nonergodic, (page 137)\n- #to/anki \n\n> recognised across a wide range of substrates – and enable us to understand the structure of living things in new ways. (page 139)\n- question: do any conflicts arise with this and enactivism? \n\n> It is the self-preservative nature of such systems, their tendency to separate from their environments and then actively maintain their own existence, that provides the elemental basis of selfhood. And it is the insulated nature of such systems, the fact that they can only register the not-self world via the sensory states of their own blankets, that constitutes the elemental basis of subjectivity – the ‘point of view’ of a sequestered self. (page 140)  \n\n> I hope you can see why biological self-organising systems must infer the hidden causes of their sensory states – albeit non-consciously, for now. If they did not, they would cease to exist. They are obliged to model causal dependencies in the world, so that their actions in that world ensure their survival. (page 141)  \n\n> Homeostasis seems to have arisen with self-organisation. (page 142)  \n\n> Like entropy, surprisal is a declining function of probability: as the probability goes down, the surprisal goes up.50 Surprisal measures how unlikely an event was; entropy measures how unlikely it is expected to be (on average).51 So, surprisal, like model entropy, is a bad thing for living organisms. I do not want us to get lost in the technicalities.52 Let me just say that, at the most brutally basic level, you are in a surprising state if you move outside the set of states you biologically expect to be in (e.g. below or above 36.5–37.5 ˚C, or breathing underwater), precisely because there is a low probability of your being in that state. (page 144)  \n\n> Self-organising systems must minimise information flow, because increasing information demand implies increasing uncertainty in the predictive model. Uncertainty yields surprises, which are bad for us biological systems because they can be dangerous. But how can we minimise surprises by minimising information flow? Isn’t that just putting our heads in the sand? The answer is no. Friston free energy is a quantifiable measure of the difference between the way the world is modelled by a system and the way the world really behaves. Therefore, we must minimise this difference. A system’s model of the world must match the real world as closely as possible, which means that it must minimise the difference between the sensory data that it samples from the world and the sensory data that were predicted by its model. This will maximise ‘mutual information’ between the world and the model, which minimises uncertainty. (page 144)  \n\n> Now, since biological systems like you and I are insulated from the world by our Markov blankets, we cannot compare our models directly with the way the world really is. We must therefore bring the whole process of minimising surprisal inside our heads, and become both the ‘source’ and ‘receiver’ of the information that flows from our question-asking. (page 145)\n- we interface with the world through our senses. we ask ourseves questions and answer them to ourselves based on sensory data \n\n> Sensory evidence (received in the form of spike trains generated inside our heads – in effect, billions of ones and zeros) are the only data we can get. From that data we must infer the causal structure of the world. Markov-blanketed beings that we are, we are obliged to rely on things like probability distributions rather than absolute truths. That is why it is useful to know that Friston free energy is always greater than surprisal; it enables our brains to approximate unknowable truths using statistical calculations. (page 145)  \n\n> The most important thing about Bayes’s theorem for the purposes of neuroscience is that it explains how perceptual inference – an unconscious process – actually works in real life, and how signal transmission actually works in real sensory-motor processing. Brain circuits literally do compute prior probability distributions and then send predictive messages to sensory neurons, in an endless effort to dampen the incoming signals; and perception literally does involve comparisons between the predicted and actual distributions, resulting in computations of posterior probability. The resultant inferences are what perception actually is.59 Perception is an endeavour to self-generate the incoming sensory signals and thereby explain them away. That is why so many neuroscientists nowadays speak of the ‘Bayesian brain’. (page 147)\n- #to/anki \n\n> The first is that the brain conspires to anticipate and thus ‘explain away’ events in the world. It suppresses predictable, uninformative incoming signals that it would otherwise have to process pointlessly. In short, each level in its hierarchy receives only the newsworthy, unexpected information transmitted from the level immediately beyond it. These feedback reports are prediction errors. (page 153)  \n\n> hierarchy of plasticity exists in terms of which the core predictions cannot change but the peripheral ones can and do; they are subject to instantaneous updating, with the intermediate levels yielding an intermediate degree of plasticity. This means that the ‘control centre’ of the brain’s homeostat (its self-model), constantly updates itself – although it shows increasing resistance to change as the cascades of errors approach its core.  (page 154)  \n\n> The fourth principle, which I have not made clear before now, is that perception (as opposed to learning) reverses the direction of information processing. By inverting the causal dependencies that shaped the predictive model in the first place, the brain produces our perceptual inferences – which Merker described as a ‘fully articulated, panoramic, three-dimensional world composed of shaped solid objects: the world of our familiar phenomenal experience’.4 (These inferences flow from left to right in Figure 15.) ‘Inversion of the predictive model’ simply means shifting from learning to predicting on the basis of what you have learnt. This is what Eve Periaqueduct did; she inferred (‘perceived’) the state of the world beyond her dam from the meteorological and seismological data she received. (page 154)  \n\n> The brain must infer the most likely causes of its incoming signals without any direct access to the unknowable world beyond its blanket. All that the brain has to go on is the way that its own sensory states (the spike trains; Figure 11) flow and alter. Its task is to use these signals to create a probabilistic model of the regularities that exist in the real world (or rather, between itself and the world) which it then uses to generate inferences that guide its actions – actions which must ensure its survival in that world. The actions, in turn, generate new sensory samples, which are used to further update the model, which it must do because models are imperfect things. This leads to new actions; and so on. (page 155)  \n\n> The body itself is a hidden world that is ‘external’ to the Markov blanket of your central nervous system. The cascade of predictions in Figure 15 could have included equivalent concentric layers culminating in the terminal visceral receptors and effectors which operate your internal organs. So the brain’s model of the world must include a model of your bodily self and its trajectory no less than it does of all the other hidden causes of interest to you. (In my earlier example, you could not have escaped the smoke-filled room if you did not have an implicit model of how your body moves and how it balances blood gases. (page 156)  \n\n> Suppressing prediction error is what controls action, no less than perception. (page 156)\n- we need to minimie our free energy. we can do that by changing our model of the world, i.e.  changing our prediction/hypothesis, or by gathering more data (action). \n\n> These bounds cannot be changed. This means – in accordance with Friston’s Law – that something else in the system must change. This is the formal, mechanistic explanation of the imperative link that exists between drive and action, and it is why there must be a hierarchy of prior predictions, some of which can be changed and some of which cannot. (page 157)\n- so the homeostatic bounds are priors that cant be changed \n\n> Bayes’s rule starts from an assumption of what we called ‘background knowledge’. The rule cannot work otherwise.8 This raises a question: where does the background knowledge come from, at the outset, before the system has gathered any evidence about the world? The answer is that our core ‘expected states’ are encoded by our species as innate homeostatic settling points – quantities that were determined by what worked effectively for our evolutionary ancestors. We are beneficiaries of the biological successes of past generations, which fix the most basic premises of our existence. (page 157)  \n\n> I said above that learning from experience produces a hierarchical model of the world that, when inverted, generates predictions about that same world.  (page 158)\n- in my own words: if i see this, then that must be the case (learning). That is the case, unless what I see implies otherwise (inference/prediction) \n\n> But the process does not end there; predictions must be tested. This causes prediction errors, which are used to update the model. (page 158)  \n\n> Prediction errors are the sensory signals that were not predicted by a current hypothesis, i.e. the ones that were not self-generated. This is the salient part of the data. (page 158)\n- error signal say: your predictions are off, says sense organ \n\n> Consciousness at its source is affect. Then it is extended outwards onto perception, to evaluate perceptual inferences, in the manner I shall now describe. (page 158)  \n\n> why and how do the natural self-preservative functions described in this chapter become conscious? We know that consciousness is grounded in affect, in feelings. (page 158)\n- grounded in affect means mostl that evolutionarily, affect was there first. also: finally tackling the hard problem \n\n> The basic question that living things must always ask themselves is: ‘What will happen to my free energy if I do that?’ Do what, though? The potential courses of action at any given moment are not arbitrary or infinite; they are dictated by current needs. There is, of course, an intimate link between needs and actions; each need demands its own adequate action. If you are hungry you must eat. If you are tired you must rest. However, there is an executive bottleneck: you can only do one or two things at once. This means that, to select your next action, you must rank your current needs by urgency. (page 159)\n- conflicting needs \n\n> We have already linked learning from experience with the Law of Affect. Affective valence – our feelings about what is biologically ‘good’ and ‘bad’ for us – guides us in unpredicted situations. We concluded that this way of feeling our way through life’s unpredicted problems, using voluntary behaviour, is the biological function of consciousness. It guides our choices when we find ourselves in the dark. But of course, for it to be able to do that, it must link our internal affects (rooted in our needs) with representations of the external world. (page 159)\n- so we feel to obtain bodily error signals and we sense the world to contextualise those and know how to act. It is conscious to prioritise needs and choose actions \n\n> the mystery of how subjective experience fits into the fabric of the physical universe – could be solved only if we reduce physiological and psychological phenomena alike to their underlying mechanistic causes. These causes were to be revealed at a depth of abstraction that only physics could provide. (page 160)  \n\n> If self-organisation and homeostasis do not by themselves explain why and how consciousness arises, what does? How, formally and mechanistically, does the biological need-prioritisation process I have just summarised relate to free-energy minimisation? And how does it happen that the outcome of this process feels like something to and for some self-organising systems? (page 160)  \n\n> But is it impossible to quantify valence? Consider Figure 12; the further the arrow deviates to the right, the greater the unpleasure. Thus, at any given moment, your hunger value might be 3/10 (which is worse than 1/10) and your thirst value might be 2/10 (which is better than 5/10), etc. Affective scientists take these sorts of measurements all the time; they ask research participants to rate their pleasures and unpleasures on what are called Likert scales. Although these scales are subjective, the fact that they are quantifiable in principle leaves the question open: why must affects be qualified? If self-organising systems can register ‘equipment-evoked responses’ (i.e. their own states) as quantities, in principle, then what does the quality add? This question concerns what philosophers call ‘qualia’ – the elusive mind stuff that supposedly cannot be accommodated within our physicalist conception of the universe. (page 160)\n- why are there qualia, ak the hard problem \n\n> Taking these factors together, it makes sense for biological self-organising systems to distinguish their needs (their error values) categorically. The distinction between categorical variables is qualitative. (page 161)  \n\n> Not only do the different needs contribute different quantities to total free energy; the different quantities also have different implications for the animal in different contexts (for example, hunger trumps sleepiness in some situations but not others) (page 161)\n- a question that I should seek to answer:  how is free energy as the degree to which an organism is not in homeostasis equate to free energy as the discrepancy between predictions and the actual world (though I understand why both should be minimised) \n\n> Increasing uncertainty is a dangerous state of affairs for any self-organising system: it predicts the system’s demise. More uncertainty demands more computational complexity (which means more information flow, which means more entropy) (page 161)  \n\n> Moreover, a complex model which accurately predicts what happens in one specific situation is unlikely to predict with equal accuracy what will happen in other situations. In statistical terms, we say that excessively complex models ‘overfit’ a data sample. (page 162)  \n\n> However, as Einstein famously said, ‘Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. (page 162)\n- #to/anki \n\n> But what matters most is that a capacity to compartmentalise enables the system to rank its needs and their attendant predictions (i.e. the salient sources of expected free energy) categorically, over time, and to focus its computational efforts upon the prioritised compartment. (page 162)\n- compartmentalisation as a way to strike a balance between complexity and accuracy (as simple as possible, but no simpler) \n\n> In the physiological terms I used in Chapter 6, the different operating modes are state functions of the brain. As I explained there, the midbrain decision triangle selects affective brain states – like ‘suffocation alarm’ mode. It does so when the PAG, the periaqueductal grey, answers the question: ‘which of these converging error signals (i.e. needs) provides the greatest opportunity for minimising my free energy?’ In other words, which need is the most salient right now? The answer is provided not only by the relative magnitudes of the competing error signals, but also by the differences between the categories (modes or states), the salience of which must be assessed in context. The contextual information, I explained, is provided by the superior colliculi. (page 163)  \n\n> Crucially, shifting into FEAR mode means that the prioritised need has become an affect. In other words, it has become conscious. Why? It becomes conscious so that deviations from expected outcomes in the most salient category of need will be felt throughout the predictive hierarchy. That is what affect is. It is the ‘equipment-evoked response’ to the question the system asked of itself: ‘which of these converging error signals provides the greatest opportunity for minimising my free energy? (page 164)  \n\n> once the midbrain decision triangle has prioritised a need, the forebrain model of its self in the world generates an expected context in which that need will be met. I said that there are two facets to this expected world: on the one hand it represents the actual content of our predictions, and on the other hand it must encode our level of confidence in those predictions. The first of these facets is supplied by the forebrain’s long-term memory networks, which filter the present through the lens of the past. I introduced the principles governing this in Chapter 7. The second facet – the adjustment of confidence levels – is modulated by ‘arousal’. (page 164)\n- good half summary of ch 6 \n\n> confidence levels attaching to predictions are learnt through experience, just like everything else. Then our level of confidence in our predictions can be predicted, just like the predictions themselves were. Predictive coding requires us to assign probabilities to the sensory states that we expect will follow from particular actions, and then compare those probabilities to the distributions actually observed in the ensuing sensory samples.  (page 165)  \n\n> This enables us to ‘weight’ the expected precision of incoming error signals relative to the precision we assigned to an outgoing prediction. This (relative degrees of confidence) will dictate the influence of the actual error signals over our predictions. (page 165)\n- Sense organ may be like: something's off, quite sure of that. Brain can counter with: very sure its alright. Nothing will happen as a result \n\n> This is a second-order kind of Bayesian inference, which entails inferences about inferences, i.e. educated confidence levels about predictions. (page 166)\n- #to/anki: precision estimates for predicgions are second-order inferences \n\n> The wide expected variance in the prior distribution (horizontal line on the left) indicates a low degree of confidence in the prior prediction, and the narrow actual variance in the sensory data sample (horizontal line on the right) indicates a high degree of confidence in the data. (page 166)\n- #to/anki: inverse relation between prediction confidence and variance \n\n> if there is high confidence in a signal then it should be allowed to revise a prior hypothesis, and if there is low confidence then it should not. Confidence affects the strength of the error signals that are propagated inward through the hierarchy. A signal in which you have high confidence (i.e. a more precise signal) is a ‘louder’ one. It will therefore have a greater chance of delivering some residual error to the core of the system and a greater chance of updating its generative model. Conversely, less precise signals – signals in which you have less confidence, also known as ‘noise’ – can be sequestered in the sensory epithelium and (one hopes) safely ignored. (page 166)\n- very important / condensed paragraph \n\n> After the decision triangle has selected its currently salient need, which determines the affective state of the system, which in turn determines the expected context that is generated by the forebrain’s long-term memory systems, the reticular activating system sets to work. The memory systems assign baseline precision values for the expected context and apply them throughout the predictive hierarchy. Then a cloud of neuromodulators billows through the forebrain, urging some channels to fire rapidly and discouraging others. These firing rates determine how much weight will be given to the current predictions and their attendant errors, which governs how ‘loudly’ the errors will be transmitted. In other words, the precision values determine how confident the system is about the outcomes it expects to follow from the course of action that now unfolds, over the various levels of the hierarchy. Then, once again, it hopes for the best but prepares for the worst. (page 168)  \n\n> Nevertheless, if hoping for the best and preparing for the worst is all we can do, this implies that some things cannot be predicted. And that’s the second part of the story. (page 168)\n- is this going to be his answer to the hard problem? \n\n> how much weight will be given to the current predictions and their attendant errors, which governs how ‘loudly’ the errors will be transmitted. In other words, the precision values determine how confident the system is about the outcomes it expects to follow from the course of action that now unfolds, over the various levels of the hierarchy. Then, once again, it hopes for the best but prepares for the worst. (page 168)  \n\n> As the action sequence unfolds, baseline confidence levels are adjusted upwards and downwards by the reticular activating system. (Think of Eve Periaqueduct’s meter readers and adjusters.) That is, the unfolding sensory-motor context is ‘palpated’ – and the system’s confidence weightings are adjusted – on the basis of unfolding fluctuations in expected uncertainty. Alterations in arousal track the estimated reliability of the sampled prediction errors. In this way, fluctuating precision values estimate the changing reliability of the unfolding signals carrying the news. These values, in turn, determine everything else the system does, in accordance with Friston’s Law. (page 169)\n- arousal follows uncertainty in sensory-motor predictions \n\n> All of this suggests that precision optimisation is the statistical-mechanical basis of signal prioritisation in general – that is, it is the critical output of everything we saw going on in the midbrain decision triangle and reticular activating system. Precision optimisation is how the multiple error signals converging on the PAG were prioritised in the first place, bringing the most salient need to affective awareness, leading to a series of unfolding choices in an expected context, guided by expected precisions. These must now be modulated on the basis of unexpected sensory events. (page 169)\n- ie, the signal with most uncertainty is prioritised, so thats what the midbrain decision triangle does, but the importance of the signal should also matter right?  \n\n> Perhaps this sounds rather abstract. I think it is, on the contrary, very true to everyday life. So much of our experience just is little pulses of feeling, as you notice things that aren’t quite as you expected them to be, followed by cognitive castings around for ways to close the gap. You remember an email you need to send: it is only when your hand fails to detect the hard screen of your phone that you realise you were already reaching for it – but if it isn’t right there beside you, where did you leave it? In the kitchen, where you were five minutes ago? (page 169)\n- #to/anki. Very intuitive quote. \n\n> A prioritised need (in this case LUST) is the currently most salient source of uncertainty. (page 170)\n- so the PAG prioritises lust and then the cortex contextualises that need (of lust satisfaction) and you attempt to minimise your uncertainty regarding lust satisfaction. So uncertainty for prioritised need satisfaction \n\n> exteroceptive awareness of action and perception as contextualised affect. Now we have a formal, mechanistic grasp on what this means. All of it is just felt uncertainty. (page 170)\n- exteroceptive awareness as contextualized affect because you see the external world through the glasses of your current affective state, seeking to minimise its satisfaction. with felt uncertainty, solms meas that the intensity of an affect represents felt uncertainty regarding the satisfaction of the need the affect represents. the affect must be placed IN the world.  \n\n> That is how saliency works. ‘Salient’ features of the world are features that, when sampled, minimise uncertainty concerning the system’s currently prioritised hypothesis: they are the ones that, when things unfold as expected, maximise our confidence in the hypothesis. Active agents are thus driven to sample the world so as to (attempt to) confirm their own hypotheses.7 (page 171)\n- nice piece on salience. makes me reconsider the vaue of the salience hypothesis in psychosis, bc why is their aberrant salience so  driven by conspiratorial and paranoid thinking? the affective need underlying their salience is one of fear \n\n> consciousness is not merely a subjective perspective upon the ‘real’ dynamics of self-organising systems; it is a function with definite causal powers of its own. The feeling of a need (as opposed to the mere existence of a need) makes a big difference to what the subject of that need will do next. Affects literally drive what an animal does from moment to moment in conditions of uncertainty. The whole purpose of exteroceptive perceptions is that they are felt in relation to the affectively driven actions they contextualise. (page 171)  \n\n> The perceptual orientation of each species is dictated by the things that matter to it. Accordingly, humans, sharks and bats live in different (subjective) worlds. You perceive objects and events only when you notice them, and different ones are salient to each species. You can only see what you sample. (page 171)\n- #to/anki. By assigning saliency, we pay attention to information that can help us gather more precise information about meeting our needs. as such, we create our world \n\n> active states (page 172)\n- action also give us information on the world based on their results \n\n> I will start with two equations that define Friston free energy in terms of the quantities I’ve introduced. The first equation says that ‘free energy is (approximately) the negative logarithm of the probability of encountering some actively authored sensory states’.14 The second one says that ‘the expected free energy decreases in (approximate) proportion to negative log precision’.15 Remember that the whole point of the self-evidencing system’s dynamics is to minimise free energy. (page 172)\n- #to/anki in predictive coding, precision is the amplitude or variance of incoming prediction errors \n\n> (1) It can act (i.e. change M) to alter sensations (φ) so that they match the system’s predictions. This is action. (page 173)\n- how i read this is that depending on the speed at which free energy goes down when precision increases (asking in a sense how mmuch there is to gain in terms of free energy), that will be how much the fcus will be on precision optimisation and therefore on consciousness \n\n> Combining all these facts about the subjectivity and intentionality of complex self-evidencing systems, we arrive at the following conclusion. The equipment-evoked responses (in Wheeler’s sense) which flow subjectively from the types of question that systems like us are obliged to ask must possess existential value and multiple qualities. Our confidence in these fluctuating responses – the ‘phenomena’ – that we register must be subjective, valenced and qualified. (page 176)\n- okay but is tha als what it HAS to feel like. why the option with qualia? \n\n> The most obvious sense in which this is so is that the world as we experience it is literally generated from cortical representations. Within the predictive coding framework, odd as it seems, what we perceive is a virtual reality constructed from the mind’s own building materials. (page 177)  \n\n> In Bayesian terms, binocular rivalry is taken to show that if the prior hypothesis that best fits the sensory data (the high likelihood that you are seeing a house-face) does not square with your background knowledge (the low probability that house-faces exist) then the hypothesis is rejected. The inference that you’re seeing a house trumps the one that you’re seeing a house-face; so, a house is what you experience. But when you test this posterior hypothesis (as a new prior) it fits only half the sensory evidence. Your background knowledge dictates that whole faces are just as probable as whole houses are. So, you change your mind and infer that you must be seeing a face; which is what you then experience. But when you test this new hypothesis, it again does not account for half the sensory evidence. And so on … (page 181)\n- #to/anki binocular rivalry \n\n> What you perceive is not the same thing as the input that arrives from your senses. What you perceive is an inference. And the materials from which that inference is derived are for the most part your cortical predictive model derived from past (i.e. expected) experiences. (page 181)  \n\n> This is the whole point of consciousness in cognition. You arrive at a situation in which you aren’t sure what to do. Consciousness comes to the rescue: you feel your way through the scenario, noting the voluntary actions that work for you. Then, gradually, the successful lessons become automatised and consciousness is no longer needed.15 (page 182)  \n\n> We have seen that affects make demands upon the mind, and that cognition performs the work so demanded.  (page 182)  \n\n> As I just said: if affect is demand made upon the mind for work, then conscious cognition is the work itself. Thus, affect both accompanies and becomes cognition. (page 183)  \n\n> What all of this implies is that the conscious state is undesirable from the viewpoint of a self-organising system. Look back at the dial diagram in Figure 12: the outer arrow represents increasing demand for work (negative affect) and the inner one represents decreasing demand (positive affect), but the ideal state is the settling point which represents no demand at all. In Chapters 7–9, I placed these matters on a formal mechanistic footing. Free-energy minimisation is the ideal state of living systems, which means that minimal surprisal is the ideal. This means, simply, that minimal need is the ideal. Affect is nothing other than the announcement of salient need. This should mean that feeling is a good thing because it enables us biological systems to resolve our needs and thereby avoid destruction. But the ideal state is surely one in which all our needs are met automatically – even before they are felt – i.e. where there is no uncertainty. In that theoretical ideal state, in which our needs are met automatically, we feel nothing. (This is how most of our bodily needs are met: they are regulated autonomically.) I say ‘theoretical ideal’ because, in respect of many of our needs, especially the emotional ones, we never get there. The SEEKING drive alone ensures that. This is the bad news. (page 183)  \n\n> the error signals with the highest precision values have the greatest influence over the generative model. Because they demand the most change – because they declare that you are doing something wrong – they represent the greatest opportunities for learning, so that you will not find yourself in the same pickle next time.  (page 183)  \n\n> What we are all aspiring to, therefore, is not pleasure (decreasing need) but zombiedom (no need). No need implies perfect predictions, which means no errors, and therefore no call to increase the precision on incoming signals, and therefore no feeling. Peace at last. (page 184)  \n\n> Freud’s aphorism, ‘consciousness arises instead of a memory trace’, should make more sense now. It means that consciousness arises when automatic behaviour leads to error, in other words, when the memory trace (a prediction) producing a behaviour does not have the expected outcome. This means that the prediction in question must be updated to accommodate the error. Cortical consciousness may therefore be described as ‘predictive work in progress’. A memory trace that is conscious is in the process of being updated. It is no longer a memory trace. Hence: consciousness arises instead of a memory trace. (page 184)\n- Freud was some kind of prophet \n\n> famous adage known as Hebb’s Law: ‘Neurons that fire together wire together’. (page 185)\n- #to/anki \n\n> Long-term memory, unlike short-term, is dependent upon the synthesis of new proteins, which is triggered after substantial and repetitive synaptic transmission, which in turn is modulated by the reticular activating system – that is, by arousal.21 Hence the famous adage known as Hebb’s Law: ‘Neurons that fire together wire together’.22 An ‘activated’ memory is an aroused memory; and an aroused memory is a memory no longer – it is in a state of uncertainty. All I am trying to convey here is that cognitive consciousness boils down to a rendering labile of cortical memory traces, and that this lability is a product of arousal. We keep arriving from different directions at the same insight: cortical processes are fundamentally unconscious things (they are simply algorithms, if left to their own devices). Consciousness – all of it – comes from the brainstem. (page 185)\n- so PAG moderates ARAS to arouse and make conscious the cortex \n\n> The goal of learning from experience is to shift as many long-term memories as possible from the declarative to the non-declarative state, for the reason that ‘declarative’ means ‘capable of returning to consciousness’. So, when I said that zombiedom is the ideal of cognition, I meant that ever deeper consolidation is the ideal of learning. Non-declarative memory is the most reliable form of memory. It entails the least amount of work. It minimises complexity and is the most generalisable (see Chapter 8). Accordingly, it is the quickest to execute; it involves the least uncertainty and therefore the least delay. (page 187)\n- #to/anki \n\n> Second, there are multiple types of non-declarative memory, and they do not all work in the same way. For example, ‘procedural’ learning occurs through brute repetition; hence we say that skills and habits such as riding a bicycle are ‘hard to learn and hard to forget’. Yet some varieties of non-declarative emotional response, which are equally hard to forget, are acquired by single-exposure learning: fear conditioning, for example. (Other types of emotional learning are slower; attachment bonding, for instance, takes about six months.) Hard-to-forget-ness is the cardinal feature of non-declarative memory; but consolidation entails very different processes in the multiple memory systems. Finally, non-declarative memories are only ‘unconscious’ in the cognitive sense. When an acquired emotional response is triggered you do feel something; you just don’t know what the feeling is about – that is, where it came from (see Chapter 3) (page 187)  \n\n> The most important fact about non-declarative memory is that it is non-declarative. It generates procedural responses, whereas declarative memory generates experienced images.27 This coincides with an anatomical distinction: declarative memories are cortical while non-declarative ones are subcortical.28 Subcortical memory traces cannot be retrieved in the form of images for the reason that they do not consist in cortical mappings of the sensory-motor end organs. They entail simpler stereotypes, of the kind that I described earlier in relation to the learnt behaviours of hydranencephalic children and decorticate animals.29 Such things cannot be brought to mind; they are not ‘thinkable’. (page 188)  \n\n> The existence of mind-wandering might seem like a challenge to the free energy theory of consciousness. I have said that we become conscious of only strong, prioritised error signals – salient ones – which we must respond to if we are to keep our biological parameters within viable bounds. Yet our thoughts often seem random and inconsequential. In some cases, we may even find our own internal monologues intrusive or distracting: unhelpful in the circumstances. How can that minimise free energy? (page 189)  \n\n> Even in the absence of compelling sensory inputs, structured neural activity continues, yielding ongoing exploration and testing of the generative model. (page 190)  \n\n> Episodic memory is a constructed process in which current goals and contexts contribute greatly to what is recalled. Thus, the past is selectively and tendentiously relived in relation to current demands for predictive work. (page 191)  \n\n> the neural systems involved in mental time travel pivot on the hippocampus, which is crucial for injecting the quality of perspectival ‘mine-ness’ into normally unconscious cortical memory processes. (page 191)  \n\n> Contemporary research on episodic memory reveals that the hippocampus is in fact just as involved in imagining the future as it is in reliving the past. (page 191)\n- so the hippocampus injects mineness into imagination \n\n> David Ingvar accordingly speaks of ‘remembering the future’42 and Daniel Schacter conceptualises the hippocampus – together with the other brain structures responsible for episodic memory – as supporting a ‘constructive episodic simulation’ of the future, which entails ‘flexible recombination of details from past events into novel scenarios’. In Schacter’s view, the episodic memory system acquires its adaptive value more from its capacity to imagine the future than to remember the past. The brain, he concludes, is ‘a fundamentally prospective organ that is designed to use information from the past and the present to generate predictions about the future’. (page 191)  \n\n> The third and last type of thinking I will discuss is thinking with words. This capacity, it seems, gives human cognition its most unique characteristic. People describe language as a tool for communication, which it is. But it is first and foremost a tool for abstraction. Some philosophers refer to this ‘other’ function of language as supra-communicative, but I prefer to think of it as pre-communicative; it is difficult to imagine how speech (as opposed to vocalisation) could have arisen without abstraction. Language does not merely express thoughts that we already have, it forms new ones. (page 191)  \n\n> To grasp the power of this mechanism, note that (in reality, rather than just in this experiment) we provide ourselves with such top-down labelling all the time, through the process of ‘inner speech’. The boost this provides is a form of non-declarative priming. Intriguingly, though, priming with words has a substantially stronger effect on consciousness than priming with concrete images. (page 192)  \n\n> Words have the power to boost whole semantic categories. Indeed, many such categories would not be thinkable – and therefore perceivable – without their verbal labels. This applies most obviously to the kind of abstract concepts we are considering in this book. Who ever saw free energy? Yet, once we can think ‘free energy’, we can see its workings everywhere. (page 193)  \n\n> This introduces the communicative function of language. The artificial manipulation of precision needn’t come only from our own generative models; it can equally come from the models of others, if they have similar capacities for abstraction. Clark lists this second function of language under the heading of ‘continuous reciprocal prediction’, while Andreas Roepstorff and Chris Frith speak of ‘script-sharing’ and ‘top-top control of action’.49 In short, the abstract labelling that controls one person’s precision can be communicated directly to that of another, bypassing the laborious business of bottom-up learning. (page 193)  \n\n> Language entails still more. It opens the door to a whole range of precision-improving techniques, such as the observations, theories and equations featured in this book. Thanks to words (and other symbols, such as mathematical ones), models acquired over an individual lifetime can become stable objects for scrutiny and systematic improvement by others – not only our contemporaries, but over generations. With its marvellous gradations of generality and specificity, language lets us project something of the structure of the predictive hierarchy itself into consciousness. These powerful aids to cognition are not available to non-symbolic species. It is very difficult to imagine the whole of science, technology and culture without language. (page 194)\n- That is big... \n\n> But there is a big difference between the feeling of affects and the associative valencing of externally perceived objects such as ripe fruit or hot fires. The difference is this: the affects are inborn but the valencing of external percepts is acquired. The visual and other perceptual qualities of percepts become ‘associated’ with affects in the empiricist sense.53 We bestow values on the world. (page 195)\n- and the last thing is what becomes ethics, but is that all acquired? \n\n> my definition of consciousness as felt uncertainty, (page 196)  \n\n> a dull artwork is like a joke whose punchline is apparent in advance. (page 196)  \n\n> We may conclude that perceptual qualia are different from affective qualia in that they are not inherently hedonically valenced; they acquire their valence in relation to affect. (page 196)  \n\n> What perception ultimately consists in is the computing of inferential statistics concerning the probability distributions of spike trains, and comparisons of such probabilities, all in a nested hierarchy of precision-optimising homeostats.56 The hierarchy generates a graphic representation in our mind’s eye of ‘equipment-evoked responses’ – phenomena in John Wheeler’s sense. Those phenomena constitute the virtual reality displayed before (and by) each of us. The resting states of the billions of little homeostats – all embedded within each other, from the surface to the depths – represents our confidence in an expected context. The context is what we expect to happen beyond our Markov blanket, when we try to resolve a prioritised need. Prioritising a need triggers cognitive work rooted in an attendant belief: the expected outcome. What you perceive consciously, on the mechanism we are now familiar with, is not this expected context, but rather the nested display – over a deep hierarchy – of prioritised deviations from your expectations. (page 196)  \n\n> ‘equipment-evoked responses’ – phenomena in John Wheeler’s sense. (page 197)\n- look up \n\n> The resting states of the billions of little homeostats – all embedded within each other, from the surface to the depths – represents our confidence in an expected context.  (page 197)\n- we are nested hierarchical homeostats, whre each deeper layer predicts the value of the more superficial layer \n\n> Precision prediction errors in perception and proprioception (when they are salient) register as exteroceptive qualia. By contrast, changing confidence in the phenotypic belief that generated the sensory-motor process in the first place is experienced in the form of affect. (page 197)\n- #to/anki \n\n> The ‘hard problem’ (as it is reverentially abbreviated) asks why and how you – ‘your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will’,2 in short, your experience of existence – could possibly spring from the physiological processes that occur in brain cells. These cells are not fundamentally different from those that constitute other bodily organs. So, how do they bring ‘you’ into being? (page 198)\n- #to/anki the hard problem \n\n> it was posed in its current form in 1995, by the philosopher David Chalmers. Let me quote his celebrated formulation of it: (page 198)\n- Chalmers and Nagel \n\n> while only cortical vision is conscious, the cortex can also process visual stimuli unconsciously, and so can the superior colliculi. (page 199)\n- #to/anki \n\n> Crick’s approach – which became the mainstream approach in cognitive neuroscience – elides what Chalmers calls the ‘hard’ part of the mind/body problem. Isolating the neural correlates of consciousness is the ‘easy’ part. It merely identifies the specific brain processes that correlate with experience; it does not explain how they cause it. That is the hard part of the problem: how and why do neurophysiological activities produce the experience of consciousness?5 In other words, how does matter become mind? According to Chalmers, we neuroscientists may be able to explain how neural information is processed in the brain while we are having visual experiences, but that does not explain how those brain processes turn into experiences. (page 200)\n- very important. Neural correlates remain only correlates, they do not help explain the hard problem \n\n> The physical facts therefore do not explain why and how there is something it is like to see. They only explain why and how the brain decodes visual information: how it sees, not how you see. This supposed irreducibility to the physical basis of what philosophers call ‘qualia’ – the something-it-is-like-ness of subjective experience – is the hard problem. (page 201)  \n\n> the view that consciousness is a mere epiphenomenon of brain processes (page 201)\n- #to/anki \n\n> One of the most compelling bits of experimental evidence for the view that consciousness is a mere epiphenomenon of brain processes is the observation by Benjamin Libet to the effect that one’s subjective decision to initiate a movement is preceded (by 300 milliseconds or so) by measurable brainwaves that announce the onset of the movement you believe you initiated.15 In other words, the physical initiation of the movement (in the brain) begins before you consciously decide to move; it is not really ‘you’ who initiates it. This finding is widely taken to prove that conscious choice – ‘free will’ – is an illusion. (page 201)\n- #to/anki and #to/file under free will stuff \n\n> bridge the explanatory gap between the inner and outer worlds? (page 202)\n- the inner world is consciousness the outer world is the rest \n\n> predictive coding framework … based on the ideas of Hermann von Helmholtz that the brain is mainly a predictive inference machine. (page 206)\n- #to/anki \n\n> The first explanatory gap is therefore one located between two different kinds of experience associated with two different observational perspectives.28 This is analogous to hearing thunder with your ears and seeing lightning with your eyes. People do not remark: ‘It is widely agreed that thunder arises from lightning, but we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises.’ This is because they do not believe that lightning produces thunder in the way that livers produce bile. They accept that they are two manifestations of the same underlying thing.29 This applies equally to the different ways of experiencing visual information processing: from the outside or the inside. From the outside (if you are a scientist with the right equipment) you see signals propagated from the retina;30 from the inside you see vivid red. (page 207)\n- elegant argument \n\n> Has the question as to why XYZ function should itself be accompanied by experience been addressed? (page 207)\n- chalmers criterium hard problem \n\n> two different kinds of explanatory gap. (page 207)  \n\n> The second explanatory gap is located between experiences (of both kinds) and their underlying causes. It is the gap between things you can experience, such as vivid reds and optogenetic scans of activated neurons, and things you cannot experience, such as quantum fields in themselves. It is, in short, a gap between the first-person and third-person perspectives. To take a third-person perspective on my own experience is to abstract myself from the experience, and to experience it no longer. This perspective concerns neither the brain as it looks nor the mind as it feels, but rather the forces explaining why and how it looks and feels as it does. That is the perspective I have taken in this book. (page 208)\n- LOOK UP. i dont quite understand it. the explantory gap between first hand and third hand. between incuding a subject-object, and looking at a subject-object from the sideline? and the first gap is between qualia of a thing and qualia of functional explanations of the thing (viviv red vs retina picture?) \n\n> if ‘the physical’ means the observable body and its organs, including the brain, then it is experienced no less than the psychological is.* Moreover, psychological experiences, when abstracted, reveal the functional mechanism of such experiences, giving rise to psychological laws. (page 208)  \n\n> The same applies to physiological laws: they too are abstracted from experience – from the observable physiological data. These two types of laws, being made of the same abstracted (explanatory) stuff, namely functions, are not as difficult to reduce to each other as the two categorically different types of experiencing are. Thus, Miller’s and Ribot’s Laws are both psychological and physiological, and that is why they can be reduced to unifying equations. Failing to make explicit the intermediate steps between experiential data and explanatory mechanisms exaggerates the hard problem and makes it appear harder than it is. You don’t have to try to imagine how one kind of experience could produce another kind of experience: you just need to come up with a mechanistic theory that explains both sets of phenomena, of whatever perspectival modality. Then you can test the predictions it gives rise to. (page 208)\n- im curious as to the critiques of this, and i wnder whether he is unknowingly taking the idealists stance here. the thing is, he admitted to bein a physicalist earlier, but now physiological laws are mind in essence? then how does it speak on the world? \n\n> A non-reductive theory of consciousness will consist in a number of psychophysical principles, principles connecting the properties of physical processes to the properties of experience. We can think of these principles as encapsulating the way in which experience arises from the physical. Ultimately, these principles should tell us what sort of physical systems will have associated experiences, and for the systems that do, they should tell us what sort of physical properties are relevant to the emergence of experience, and just what sort of experience we should expect any given physical system to yield. (page 209)\n- chalmers \n\n> To explain psychology in relation to physiology, we must abstract ourselves from the observed phenomena of both kinds (i.e. we must infer functional mechanisms, of both kinds) – and then abstract ourselves from the two sets of abstractions to see the unifying common denominator. In doing so, we must situate ourselves at an equal distance from them both (i.e. we must infer sufficiently deep mechanisms to account for the functions of both psychology and physiology); only then can we reconcile the phenomena and their underlying mechanisms with each other. (page 210)\n- elegantly put \n\n> But there is more. Having taken his stand against reducing ‘experience’ to ‘the physical’, Chalmers goes on to say (as if to illustrate the conflation) that they are nevertheless dual aspects of something else. The ‘something else’, according to him, is information – which, I agree, is not something physical in the physiological sense but which, in my view, is something physical in the functional sense of statistical mechanics. This move introduces Chalmers’s second principle. He calls it the ‘Double-Aspect Principle’, which he says is more basic than the Principle of Structural Coherence: (page 211)  \n\n> We have seen that everything pivots on the aim and purpose of the information processing. When it comes to consciousness, this means minimising entropy. But it is more complicated than that: one also needs a Markov blanket. Then it entails minimising your own entropy. (page 215)\n- purpose of consciousness \n\n> If only some things, or only organisms, or only some organisms, are subjects of experience, then consciousness cannot be a fundamental property of the universe. There certainly was a dawn of life: there is an abundance of empirical evidence for this. And life emerged a long, long while after the Big Bang. Therefore, there surely was a good deal of time before consciousness existed. This assumption alone – that there was a dawn of consciousness – obliges us to find a physical explanation for it. If there was a dawn, there must have been something prior to consciousness that explains it. The alternative notion – that consciousness preceded life and the universe – doesn’t fit the facts as they appear to be, and moreover it sounds unhelpfully like the idea of God. Unless you invoke ideas like that, consciousness must have arisen from, and therefore must be part of, a non-conscious physical universe. (page 216)\n- pretty good argument against idealism. note to self: what was I again, a weak epistemic phenomenalist? \n\n> This applies even within ourselves. We saw in previous chapters that perception and cognition are not necessarily accompanied by consciousness. In fact, the scientific evidence suggests that perception and cognition are mostly unconscious. I cited Kihlstrom’s and Bargh and Chartrand’s classic review articles in this connection. After reviewing the evidence, these scientists came to the conclusion that we are unconscious of our psychological acts ‘most of the time’. (page 216)  \n\n> unconscious intentionality derives from conscious learning from experience) (page 216)  \n\n> If most ‘moment-to-moment psychological life’ carries on without experience, then why can’t thermostats and the internet be unconscious? If the being of the non-declarative basal ganglia of the brain is not ‘intrinsically experiential’ (to use Chalmers’s term), then how can all information be experiential? (page 216)\n- subjectivity is not equal to consciousness. subjectivity is simply perspective taking. \n\n> the primary function of consciousness is not perceiving or remembering or comprehending but feeling. (page 217)  \n\n> If the blind visual neuroscientist Mary were an affective neuroscientist, would her knowledge of everything there is to know about the function of feeling not explain why (indeed predict that) it feels like something? (page 218)\n- hes asking whether his explanation of feeling bridges the explanatory gap \n\n> But the same kind of gap does not exist between the function of feeling and the experience of it. Some philosophers will claim there still is such a gap. They will point out that ‘affective zombies’ are conceivable.42 I suggest that this will be based in the historical preoccupations of their discipline rather than reasonable perplexity, and I appeal to them to consider the issue afresh. (page 218)\n- I would counter this too. Must think about this. \n\n> Concerns about an ‘explanatory gap’ would never have arisen if we had begun our quest by asking why and how feelings arise, rather than by looking for a neural correlate of consciousness in the visual cortex. (page 218)  \n\n> Does this clear up every last mystery about the nature of consciousness? Here I must admit to a residue of discomfort. How strange it would be if all that has ever been experienced – if the very knowability of the universe itself – depended on the mechanisms I have described. (page 219)  \n\n> All explanations must take something as given, and therefore inexplicable within the theory. Every story must end somewhere. (page 219)\n- isnt there some conjecture that someone close to Von Neumann discovered that he himself wouldnt accept at first, read in Labatut's The Maniac? \n\n> All explanations must take something as given, and therefore inexplicable within the theory. Every story must end somewhere. For me, the trail ends with information, which is undoubtedly puzzling stuff, and with self-organisation, which is positively uncanny. In the account of consciousness that I have given, everything springs from a system’s drive to exist. Our minds are woven from order itself, which emerges spontaneously from chaos as in Friston’s experiment, and then defends itself against the onslaughts of entropy. How can this be the basis for our existence? What is order, that it has such powers to conjure us out of the inanimate darkness before and beyond us? These questions exceed the scope of this book. For all I know, they elude enquiry altogether. (page 219)  \n\n> What if we are all, like them, lacking the machinery that would, if we had it, enable us to come to radically better conclusions about ourselves and our place in the universe? If we were all endowed with only a sense of hearing, we might think that reality consisted in something as ethereal as sound waves, and we would have no conception of the visible and tangible world of mental solids. Since we would all be constrained by the same incomplete evidence, we would all reach the same wrong conclusions. By the same reasoning, if we had an additional bit of brain – say, five lobes per hemisphere instead of the usual four – perhaps we would know something about the nature of things that we are currently missing. (page 221)\n- intersting observation \n\n> we may suppose that consciousness did not exist on earth before brains evolved – and perhaps only when vertebrate brains evolved; therefore, about 525 million years ago. I suspect it arose in rudimentary form before that; that a precursor of affect gradually became felt affect, with no sharp dividing line between them, in tandem with the evolution of increasingly complex organisms with multiple competing needs. What emerged with the evolution of cortex was cognitive consciousness – that is, the additional capacity to contextualise affect exteroceptively and hold it in mind. (page 222)\n- evolutionary perspective on consciousness \n\n> Therefore, on the basis of the evidence I marshalled in Chapter 6, we may conclude that consciousness as we know it requires the existence of something which looks like the PAG, or its immediate evolutionary precursor, together with its adjacent equipment in the midbrain decision triangle and reticular activating system. (page 222)  \n\n> Principle of Organisational Invariance. (page 223)  \n\n> According to this principle, what matters for the emergence of experience is not the specific physical makeup of a system, but the functional pattern of causal interaction between its components. (page 223)  \n\n> Here comes the imaginary experiment: (page 223)  \n\n> ‘some may worry that a silicon isomorph of a neural system might be impossible for technical reasons. That question is open. The invariance principle says only that if an isomorph is possible, then it will have the same sort of conscious experience. (page 224)  \n\n> Moreover, I no longer see why I assumed that affect is not a form of information processing. (page 228)\n- i havent fully grasped this either, but its at the center of free energy stuff \n\n> Much else that is useful could be added by studying more closely the physiological means by which the PAG processes the multiple converging inputs it receives, and how exactly decisions regarding ‘what to do next’ are made when it interfaces with the superior colliculi. But such research would still belong under the heading of what Chalmers calls the ‘easy’ problem. (page 229)\n- indeed a question i still have \n\n> Consciousness (in the sense of uncertainty felt by the system) (page 233)  \n\n> contextual basis, and then hold one such intention ‘in mind’ (in a short-term memory buffer) to guide its unfolding choices in uncertain environments. (page 233)\n- arent humans able to hold multiple conflicting needs that in solms theory would be decided on at the level of the PAG in cortical consciousness at the same time? even midbrain decision triangle stuff can thus be made conscious, but by itself? isnt this circular? \n\n> Although it is true that many neuroscientists interpret these facts differently from me, it is also true that others have come to very similar conclusions. Although each of them has emphasised different aspects and nuanced them differently, nevertheless it is fair to say that Jaak Panksepp, Antonio Damasio and Bjorn Merker, at least, have all come to the view that (1) consciousness is generated in the upper brainstem, (2) it is fundamentally affective, and (3) it is an extended form of homeostasis. These facts combined mean that consciousness is not as complicated as we previously thought. It is therefore reasonable to expect that we can engineer it. The only major addition that this book makes to these conclusions is (4) the Free Energy Principle. That, too, is not very complicated in its essence; in fact, its great appeal lies in the fact that it reduces almost all mental and neurological processes to a single mechanism, and renders them computable. (page 240)\n- on its legitimacy, peer review and novelty \n\n> Robin Carhart-Harris (who attended some of the early neuropsychoanalytic meetings held in London) has independently published ideas along similar lines.41 The same applies to the social neuroscientist Katerina Fotopoulou, who recognised the link between uncertainty (inverse precision) and consciousness as early as 2013.42 (page 241)  \n\n> Feeling is a precious inheritance. It carries within it the wisdom of the ages: an inheritance that extends backwards over aeons to the beginning of life itself. When homeostasis eventually gave rise to feelings, the crux of this new capacity was that it enabled us to know how we are doing within a biological scale of values. Feelings entrain predictions that are grounded in the accumulated experiences in situations of biological significance of literally all our ancestors. Feelings enable us to do what is best for us, even as we do not know why we do so. I have asked you before to imagine what would happen if each of us had to learn afresh which foodstuffs contain high energy supplies and if we had to discover for ourselves what happens when we jump off cliffs. Due to the unbidden feelings that attract us to sweetness and make us avoid heights, we ‘just know’ (at a first approximation) what to do and when. For example, we know what to do when babies cry, predators attack, or frustrating obstacles get in our way. This innate knowledge – which is conveyed to us explicitly only in the form of feelings – is what makes it possible for us to survive in the highly unpredictable worlds that we do, where motor vehicles hurtle around us and carbon dioxide fills the air. (page 244)  \n\n> cortical functioning is accompanied by consciousness only if it is ‘enabled’ by the reticular activating system of the upper brainstem. Damage to just two cubic millimetres of this region obliterates all consciousness. Many people believe that this is because the brainstem modulates the quantitative level of consciousness, or ‘wakefulness’; but that view is unsustainable. The consciousness generated by the upper brainstem has qualitative content of its own. This is affect. Since cortical consciousness is contingent upon brainstem consciousness, affect is revealed to be the foundational form of consciousness. The sentient subject is literally constituted by affect. (page 247)\n- very good summary \n\n> Affect is an extended form of homeostasis, which is a basic biological mechanism that arose naturally with self-organisation. Self-organising systems survive because they occupy limited states; they do not disperse themselves. This survival imperative led gradually to the evolution of the complex dynamical mechanisms that underwrite intentionality. Crucially, the selfhood of self-organising systems grants them a point of view. That is why it becomes meaningful to speak of the subjectivity of such a system: deviations from their viable states are registered by the system, for the system, as needs. (page 247)  \n\n> Needs cannot all be felt at once. They are prioritised by a midbrain decision triangle, where current needs (residual prediction errors, quantified as free energy) converging on the periaqueductal grey are ranked in relation to current opportunities (displayed in the form of a two-dimensional ‘saliency map’ in the superior colliculi). This triggers conditioned action programmes, which unfold in expected contexts over a deep hierarchy of predictions (the generative model of the expanded forebrain). The actions that are generated by prioritised affects are voluntary, which means they are subject to here-and-now choices rather than pre-established algorithms. Such choices are felt in exteroceptive consciousness, which contextualises affect. The choices are made on the basis of fluctuating precision-weighting (a.k.a. arousal, modulation, post-synaptic gain) of the incoming error signals that are rendered salient by prioritised needs, while they are buffered in working memory, with the aim of minimising uncertainty (maximising confidence) in a current prediction as to how the need can be met. This is ‘reconsolidation’. As Freud said, ‘consciousness arises instead of a memory trace’. (page 248)  \n\n> Reliably successful choices result in long-term adjustments of sensory-motor predictions. Thus, exteroceptive consciousness is predictive work in progress, the aim of which is to establish ever deeper (more certain, less conscious) predictions as to how needs may be resolved. This long-term consolidation – and the transition from ‘declarative’ to ‘non-declarative’ memory systems – requires reduction of complexity in the predictive model, to facilitate generalisability. We aspire to automaticity – absolute confidence – but we can never achieve it completely. To the extent that we fail, we suffer feelings. Since we never achieve errorless prediction, the default drive (when all goes well) is SEEKING – proactive engagement with uncertainty, with the aim of resolving it in advance. When this affect is prioritised, it is felt as curiosity and interest in the world. (page 248)  \n\n> All known conscious systems are alive but not all living systems are conscious. Likewise, all living systems are self-evidencing but not all self-evidencing systems are alive. If the argument laid out here is correct, then, in principle, an artificially conscious self-evidencing system can be engineered. Consciousness can be produced. This will realise the wildest dreams of Helmholtz and other members of the Berlin Physical Society. However, we must question our motives for doing this, accept collective responsibility for the potentially dire consequences and proceed with extreme caution.

    "content": "## Review\nHet duizend eilanden experiment van Frank van Dongen is een Nederlandse sci-fi-roman waarin genationaliseerde social mediagiganten een wereldwijd aandachtsmonopolie op het met automatische medicatie-implantaten in toom gehouden volk hebben. Elke vorm van zelfexpressie -een eigen zaak hebben, een feestje houden, er überhaupt ideeën op nahouden- wordt ontmoedigd of is verboden. Met de magisch-realistische connectie tussen de hoofdpersoon en zijn eeneiige tweelingbroer ontvouwt zich een mysterieuze verhaallijn op een andere planeet, waarbij de dreiging van intelligent buitenaards leven als een rode draad door het verhaal blijft lopen.\n\nIn dit boek komen in de eerste plaats *veel* verschillende sciencefictionthema's aan bod. Een aantal daarvan zijn klassiekers: de expansie van de mensheid tussen de sterren, een dreigende alieninvasie, en de Frankenstein-achtige experimenten van Jack, de hoofdpersoon. Tegelijkertijd behandelt de schrijver ook meer eigentijdse thema's. Zoals SoNet, het almachtige staatsmediabedrijf, dat de levens van de massa's volledig in hun greep heeft, en ze dag en nacht voedt met VR-amusement en VR-porno. We zijn er nog ver van verwijderd, en toch voel ik (en ik ben niet de enige) een vergelijkbaar gevoel van vervreemding en versplintering ten gevolge van de digitalisering van ons sociale leven. En ook een vergelijkbare strijd om me daartegen te weren, als Jack zegt dat hij zich \"met fysieke maatregelen tegen de verleidingen van SoNet moet beschermen, om te voorkomen dat hij er in momenten van zwakte en verlangen weer aan toegeeft\". \nEen ander geslaagd thema is de *brain-computer interface*. Met name de fictieve psychische gevolgen daarvan zijn mooi beschreven en stemmen me tot nadenken. De schrijver schetst hoe voor kinderen bij wie externe geheugenimplantaten geïmplanteerd zijn, de grens tussen dat wat van hen en dat wat van het implantaat is, vervaagt. De kinderen weten niet meer waar zijzelf eindigen, en waar hun digitale verlengstuk begint. Dat deed me denken aan de waan die sommige mensen met een psychose krijgen: de beïnvloedingswaan. Daarbij raken mensen ervan overtuigd dat iets dat buiten hun ligt, zoals een satelliet, hun bestuurt. We noemen dat ook wel een probleem met de *zelfafgrenzing*. De beïnvloedingswaan wordt op die manier een technologische realiteit. Op deze manier passeren nog een aantal thema's de revue, en vaak lukt het om hele complexe en actuele problemen op een verhalende en begrijpelijke manier aan de man te brengen. Dat is bewonderenswaardig en leuk om te lezen, maar er kleven ook een aantal nadelen aan. \n\nZo lijkt de schrijver een sterke drang te hebben om de lezer iets bij te brengen. Om dat te bereiken bevat het boek regelmatig langdradige, lezing-achtige monologen, die met momenten didactisch overkomen. Regelmatig lezen gesprekken tussen personages daardoor meer als opgeknipte monologen, dan als echte dialogen. Bovendien wordt het taalgebruik in zulke passages gekenmerkt door droge opsommingen die aan beleidsdocumenten doen denken. Dit soort ellenlange “onderdelen, aspecten, vormen, maten, en soorten” opsommingen vervelen gauw. De schrijver wekt die indruk niet alleen met zijn schrijfwijze, maar ook met de eentonigheid van de wereldvisie die de personages in hun monologen tentoonspreiden. \nDe personages zijn  niet alleen overtuigd van hun superieure intelligentie, maar ook van hun morele superioriteit ten opzichte van het aan *AI-generated* amusement verslaafde klootjesvolk. Dat valt te begrijpen voor de *private school kids* waarmee Jack omgaat, maar bij Jack, die toch een man van het volk was, voelt het misplaatst. De elite die zichzelf zo graag schouderklopjes geeft ontbreekt het bovendien aan een vermogen tot zelfreflectie. Zo beschrijft Valery op enig moment hoe haar werkverslaafde moeder nooit tijd voor haar had, en zegt op de volgende pagina dat zij \"opgroeiden in een oase van aandacht en verzorging van de intellectuele en politieke elite\", terwijl Jack \"rondzwierf in de geestdodende krochten van het laagste volk\". De *savior complex* om de mensheid te redden, waarvan de hoofdpersonen stuk voor stuk doordrongen zijn, blijkt niet zo nobel wanneer blijkt dat ze vooral van plan zijn *zichzelf* van de ondergang te redden. En dan heb ik het nog niet gehad over de opvallend ouderwetse manier waarop in dit boek naar man-vrouwverhoudingen wordt gekeken. Daarbij doen vrouwen vaak denken aan tamme hertjes, terwijl mannen, die in positieve zin als “seksuele roofdieren” worden beschreven, \"wel even\" jacht op ze zullen maken. \n\nHoewel het dit boek op een laagdrempelige manier lukt om moeilijke, niet onrealistische toekomstscenario's uit te leggen, tiert de klassistische, ouderwetse wereldvisie die de personages erop nahouden welig in dit boek. Ik denk dat mijn behoefte om de morele houding van de fictieve personages in dit boek te bekritiseren dan ook ontstaat omdat de indruk gewekt wordt dat het hier vooral de schrijver zélf is die op de bühne staat.",

The guiding principles for human interaction (might be) similar, but simple imperatives or mechanisms like those in bacteria wouldn’t suffice. They would also cloud our advanced judgement making capabilities and make them in a sense obsolete. Subtle, less stringent imperatives are needed, in the form of affect.\nBesides being subtle, they are also individualized. Instead of having general rules that apply to everyone in the group, every single individual has slightly different rules fitted to their role in the group. Apply this to dominance hierarchies.\n25: at this point, he says ‘we can think of feelings as mental deputies of homeostasis’. At first I thought; sodium content in a cell being high is not similar to feeling good, because both ends of the spectrum are bad. But of course both high and low sodium are bad, perfect sodium for cellular functioning is good. Similar to f(x) = x^2.\nStill, it is obvious that less pain is usually beneficial for a human, but isn’t he at this point simply stretching the word homeostasis to include the instinct to ‘endure and prevail’ of an organism?\n26: what about selection at group level?\n31: Memories and language allows cultural evolution to join genetic evolution.\n32: he sums things homeostasis led to, among them the capability to measure appropriate responses to changes in homeostatic balances. Dysfunctional measurement can lead to overreaction; a way by which to explain psychiatric disorders?\n37: Fermi’s paradox; all calculations say there’s a lot of aliens yet there’s no proof of it.\n45: is it really more than a steady state, or simply a steady state that collects more resources than it technically needs to survive?\n50: no proof yet that cognition and homeostasis are somehow related\n\nCultural evolution and the Jungian collective unconscious, also compare to Harari’s mention of the ‘split between biology and history’\n\n100: what does provoked mean? Why are internal drives “provoked” but bodily sensations (driven by external forces disrupting homeostasis) are not?\n\n101: no feelings does not mean no judgement, but also it does because no feelings means no reason to judge.\n\n103:\n\n105: finally, an explanation of how feelings tell us a lot about the body.\n106: is he saying we can die of mania?",

(2013):\n- Chapter 2, section 2.2: Assessing model accuracy --pp.29-36\n- Chapter 5, introduction and section 5.1 on cross-validation should be known: -- pp.175-184\n- Not: cross-validation in the classification context, section 5.1.\n- Chapter 6, section 6.2 on shrinkage methods should be known: -- pp.214-228\n- Chapter 6, section 6.4 on considerations in high dimensions should be known: -- pp.238-244\n\n## 2.2 Assessing Model Accuracy\n\nThe most commonly-used measure to assess how well a model’s predictions match the observed data is:\n\n$MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i))^2$\n\n- $\\hat{f}(x_i)$ is the prediction $\\hat{f}$ gives for its $i$th observation.  \n    \nGenerally, we are interested in the accuracy of predictions when we apply our model to previously unseen test data.\n\nWe are not very interested in knowing whether $\\hat{f}(x_i) \\approx y_i$; we want to know whether $\\hat{f}(x_0) \\approx y_0$, where $(x_0, y_0)$ is previously unseen test data.  \n\nWe can write test error as:\n\n$mean(y_0 - \\hat{f}(x_0))^2$\n\n- The average squared error on unseen data.\n    \n\n### Why just using training error is insufficient\n\nAlthough $MSE_{test}$ and $MSE_{train}$ are closely related, there is no guarantee that the lowest  training MSE will also have the lowest test MSE.\n![[Pasted image 20221206162237-1.png]]\n- The  image shows how linear regression model (orange) has a fit that is not good enough, leading to high test and training error (orange squares on the right).\n    \n- The green line follows the data points very closely, resulting in very low training error but very high test error (green squares). The model is too *specific*, it does not generalize to new data.\n    \n- The blue line fits the true model (in black) the closest, resulting in optimally low training error and test error (blue squares).\n    \n- The dashed horizontal line represents the irreducible error $Var(\\epsilon)$, which corresponds to the lowest achievable test MSE among all possible methods.\n    \n\n\n\nThe properties train MSE and test MSE of statistical models behave as follows with increasing flexibility (i.e., df):\n\n- Monotone decrease in MSE train\n    \n- U-shape in test MSE\n    \n\nThis is a fundamental property of statistical learning which holds regardless of the data set or statistical method.\n\n> When a given method yields a small training MSE but a large test MSE, we are said to be overfitting the data. This happens because our statistical learning procedure is working too hard to find patterns in the training data, and may be picking up some patterns that are just caused by random chance rather than by true properties of the unknown function f . ([Sohil et al., 2022, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/RMYG8SVF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UPVSKJPR?page=43&annotation=4XYUJHIH))\n\nRegardless of whether overfitting occurred, the training MSE will be smaller than the test MSE. Overfitting only applies when a less flexible model would have yielded a smaller test MSE.\n\nGenerally, the training MSE is easy to calculate, but estimating test MSE is considerably more difficult because usually no test data are available. An important method to do this is *cross-validation*; a method that estimates test MSE using training data.\n\n## 2.2.2 The Bias-Variance Trade-Off\n\nThe test error’s U-shape is the result of the bias-variance trade-off: the expected test MSE, for a value $x_0$ can always be decomposed into the sum of 3 fundamental quantities:\n\n1. variance of $\\hat{f}(x_0)$\n    \n2. squared bias of $\\hat{f}(x_0)$\n    \n3. variance of the irreducible error $Var(\\epsilon)$\n    \n\n$E(y_0 - \\hat{f}(x_0))^2 = Var(\\hat{f}(x_0)) + [Bias(\\hat{f}(x_0))]^2 + Var(\\epsilon)$\n\nWhere:\n\n- $E(y_0 - \\hat{f}(x_0))^2$ is the *expected test MSE* at $x_0$ that we would obtain after repeated estimation of $f$ using a large number of training sets.\n    \n    - The expected test MSE can never lie below $Var(\\epsilon)$, the irreducible error.\n        \n- $Var(\\hat{f}(x_0))$ is the variance of the model, i.e, the amount by which $\\hat{f}$ would change if we estimated it using a different training data set (since the training data are used to fit $\\hat{f}$, different training data will result in a different model).\n    \n    - High variance means small changes in training data can result in large changes in $\\hat{f}$.\n        \n    - More flexible statistical methods have higher variance, which makes sense considering that it more closely follows the data points so it will vary more when those data points change.\n        \n- $[Bias(\\hat{f}(x_0))]^2$ is the bias, which refers to the *error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model.*\n    \n    - For example, linear regression assumes linear relationships between $Y$ and $X_1, X_2,…,X_p$. It is unlikely that real-life problems truly have such simple linear relationships, so linear regression will undoubtedly introduce bias.\n        \n\n> bias refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model. For example, linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between Y and X1,X2,...,Xp. It is unlikely that any real-life problem truly has such a simple linear relationship, and so performing linear regression will undoubtedly result in some bias in the estimate of f . ([Sohil et al., 2022, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/RMYG8SVF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UPVSKJPR?page=46&annotation=C4SP3ICW))\n\nGenerally, more flexible models result in higher variance and lower bias.\n\n> The relative rate of change of these two quantities determines whether the test MSE increases or decreases. As we increase the flexibility of a class of methods, the bias tends to initially decrease faster than the variance increases. Consequently, the expected test MSE declines. However, at some point increasing flexibility has little impact on the bias but starts to significantly increase the variance. When this happens the test MSE increases. ([Sohil et al., 2022, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/RMYG8SVF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UPVSKJPR?page=46&annotation=2TP6Z9ZT))\n\n![[Pasted image 20221206162321-1.png]]\n## 5 Resampling methods\n\nCross-validation can estimate test error to:\n\n- Evaluate performance (model assessment)\n    \n- Select appropriate level of flexibility (model selection)\n    \n\nIt does this by *holding out* a subset of the training observations from the fitting process, and then applying the model to those held out observations.\n\n### 5.1.1 Validation set approach\n\nInvolves randomly dividing the available dataset into a *training set* and a *validation set* or *hold-out set*. The *validation set error rate* (usually MSE) estimates the true test error rate.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221206162331-1.png]]\n#### Downsides\n\n1. High variance, depending on precisely which observations end up in the training set and which observations are in the validation set.\n    \n2. The model is trained on only half of the data, and models perform worse on fewer observations, so the validation set error rate may overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire dataset.\n    \n\n### 5.1.2 Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation\n\nUses a single observation $(x_1, y_1)$ as the validation set and the remaining observations$\\{(x_1, y_1),…,(x_n, y_n)\\}$ make up the training set.\n\n![[Pasted image 20221206162343-1.png]]\nIn other words, the model is *fit* on the $n-1$ training observations, and a prediction $\\hat{y}_1$ is made for the excluded observation using the value $x_1$.\n\nSince $(x_1, y_1)$ wasn’t used in the fitting process, $MSE_1 = (y_1 - \\hat{y}_1)^2$ is an approximately unbiased estimate for the test error.\n\nStill, it’s highly variable, being based on just one observation. So, we repeat the process, using each observation $(x_n, y_n)$ in the data to estimate the test error.\n\nAveraging all these $MSE_i$ values gives us the $CV_{(n)}$:\n\n$CV_{(n)} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum^n_{i=1}MSE_i$\n\n#### Advantages over validation set approach\n\n1. Far less bias because the model is fitted on $n-1$ observations (almost the entire dataset) leading to less overestimation of test error.\n    \n2. Outcome is not variable as there is no randomness in training/validation splits.\n    \n\n## 5.1.3 k-Fold Cross-Validation\n\nInvolves dividing the dataset into $k$ groups, or *folds*, of approximately equal size. The first fold is the validation set, and the remaining $k-1$ folds are the training data. The $MSE_1$ is computed on the observations in the held-out fold. This is repeated $k$ times, resulting in $MSE_1, MSE_2,…,MSE_k$.\n\nAveraging these gives us:\n\n$CV_{(k)} = \\frac{1}{k}\\sum^k_{i=1}MSE_i$\n\nIn practice, one typically uses $k=5$ or $k=10$, but why?\n\n- It’s less computationally expensive.\n    \n- It often gives more accurate estimates of the test error (see 5.1.4)\n    \n\nNote that cross-validation generally underestimates the true test error.\n\n> When we perform cross-validation, our goal might be to determine how well a given statistical learning procedure can be expected to perform on independent data; in this case, the actual estimate of the test MSE is of interest. But at other times we are interested only in the location of the minimum point in the estimated test MSE curve. This is because we might be performing cross-validation on a number of statistical learning methods, or on a single method using different levels of flexibility, in order to identify the method that results in the lowest test error. For this purpose, the location of the minimum point in the estimated test MSE curve is important, but the actual value of the estimated test MSE is not. ([Sohil et al., 2022, p. 214](zotero://select/library/items/RMYG8SVF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UPVSKJPR?page=214&annotation=233P64K9))\n\n## 5.1.4 Bias-Variance Trade-Off for k-Fold Cross-Validation\n\nBias in the different approaches:\n\n- Validation set approach overestimates test error because the model is fitted on half the data.\n    \n- LOOCV gives approximately unbiased estimates of test error rates because the model is trained on $n-1$ observations.\n    \n- k-fold cross-validation gives an intermediate level of bias.\n    \n\nSo, from the perspective of bias reduction, LOOCV wins. But, we must also consider the procedure’s variance.\n\nLOOCV has higher variance than k-fold CV with $k<n$.\n\n> the mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than does the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated ([Sohil et al., 2022, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/RMYG8SVF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UPVSKJPR?page=215&annotation=3YD4XFRK))\n\nLooking at LOOCV, the test error estimates are highly correlated, whereas for k-fold CV, the test error estimates of $k$ fitted models are somewhat less correlated. That is because there is less overlap between training sets.\n\n> To summarize, there is a bias-variance trade-off associated with the choice of k in k-fold cross-validation. Typically, given these considerations, one performs k-fold cross-validation using k = 5 or k = 10, as these values have been shown empirically to yield test error rate estimates that suffer neither from excessively high bias nor from very high variance. ([Sohil et al., 2022, p. 215](zotero://select/library/items/RMYG8SVF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UPVSKJPR?page=215&annotation=AY5UVKFY))\n\n## 6.2 Shrinkage Methods\n\n### 6.2.1 Ridge regression\n\nShrinking, constraining or regularizing the values of coefficient estimates improve the fit by greatly reducing their variance.\n\n$\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p\\beta^2_j$ is called a _shrinkage penalty_.  \n\nStandard least squares method is _scale equivariant_, i.e., the scale doesn’t matter. For ridge regression, the values of the regression coefficients **do** depend on the scale of the predictors. Therefore, apply ridge regression after standardization, by dividing by SD for each predictor: $x_{standardized} = \\frac{x}{SD}$.\n\nAs $\\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases, leading to decreased variance but increased bias.

  Pink = MSE\n    \n-   Green = variance\n    \n-   Black = bias\n    \n\nFor OLS, if $p> n$, the estimates do not have a unique solution, while ridge regression trades off a small increase in bias for a large decrease in variance. It works best when OLS estimates have high variance.\n\n> Ridge regression also has substantial computational advantages over best subset selection, which requires searching through 2p models. As we discussed previously, even for moderate values of p, such a search can be computationally infeasible. In contrast, for any fixed value of λ, ridge regression only fits a single model, and the model-fitting procedure can be performed quite quickly. In fact, one can show that the computations required to solve (6.5), simultaneously for all values of λ, are almost identical to those for fitting a model using least squares. (Sohil et al., 2022, p. 249)\n\n### 6.2.2 The Lasso\n\n> Hence, much like best subset selection, the lasso performs variable selection. As a result, models generated from the lasso are generally much easier to interpret than those produced by ridge regression. We say that the lasso yields sparse models—that is, sparse models that involve only a subset of the variables. (Sohil et al., 2022, p. 250)\n\n#### Why does the lasso reduce coefficients to exactly

of the graphs:**\n\n-   Plotted against each other are the values for 2 regression coefficients $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$.\n    \n-   The black dot with $\\hat{\\beta}$ represents the OLS estimate for both regression coefficients.\n    \n-   The red ellipses are called contours, all points on each ellipse yield the same RSS (but different values for $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$). The further from $\\hat{\\beta}$ they are, the higher the RSS. In reality, these circles are non-discrete (you could draw an infinite number of circles), and they could expand indefinitely for ever-increasing values of RSS.\n    \n-   The blue areas are the constraint regions for the lasso (left) and the ridge regression (right).\n    \n\nThe regression coefficients are given by the first point at which an ellipse contacts the constraint region.\n\nFor the lasso regression, because the constraint region has **corners**, it will often make contact with the ellipse at an axis. _If it does_, one of the coefficients will equal zero. In the example, $\\beta_1$ will be reduced to zero, so the model will only include $\\beta_2$.\n\nThe figure is an example for $p = 2$. For $p = 3$, lasso becomes a polyhedron and ridge regression a sphere.  \n\n### Ridge regression vs. lasso\n\nIf no variables are reduced to zero, ridge outperforms lasso slightly. If some variables are reduced to zero, lasso outperforms ridge.\n\n* * *\n\n**Anki:**\n\n==- Describe the behaviour of the properties train MSE and test MSE of statistical models with increasing flexibility (i.e., df).\n    \n==- Definition of regression\n    ==\n==- The mean of many highly correlated quantities has higher variance than does the mean of many quantities that are not as highly correlated==",

A celebrated whirlpool on the coast of Norway. \n\n> Paul confessing that, although he himself had lost faith as a very young boy, he had always appreciated pious men such as Rutgers, and would have been unable to survive without constant congress with actively religious individuals, for in their belief in a sacred order upholding the entire world, however naïve and misplaced, he found a small measure of hope. (page 24)  \n\n> He read voraciously and studied day and night. I once saw him take two books to the toilet, for fear that he might finish the first one before he was done. (page 43)  \n\n> I have often wondered about the consciousness of animals, how it must be more shadowy than ours, more dreamlike and fleeting, small thoughts like half-burned candles, their outlines never fully formed. And perhaps that is also the case for many of us who must strain to think with clarity. (page 45)\n- animal consciousness \n\n> When four-five saw me smoking at window staring out, asked, Mommy, what are you calculating? (page 46)  \n\n> Yes, it was terrible, but no major battles were fought inside our country. Hungary was the breadbasket for Austria-Hungary, and wartime shortages boosted wheat prices so much that the rich actually became richer. So many of us acted as if nothing was happening. This might seem shocking, I know, but it taught me a simple human truth that I learned very early on, which is that you can dance even with the devil knocking at your door. (page 54)  \n\n> Arthurian quest, (page 64)\n- holy grail stories, final answers, complete theories.

It is not what people think. It is not knowledge for its own sake. It is not a search for patterns, nor is it a series of abstract, intellectual games completely unconnected from the real world and its many troubles. It is something quite other. Mathematics is the closest we can come to the mind of Hashem. And so, it should be practiced with reverence, because it has true power, a power that can be easily used for evil, as it is born from a faculty that only we possess, and that the Lord, blessed be He, gave us instead of teeth, claws, or talons, but that is equally dangerous and lethal. Of this, I taught him nothing. Whatever judgment awaits me, I cannot deny that I saw it before anyone else. What he could do. It was so rare and beautiful that to watch him was to weep. Yes, I saw that, but I also saw something else. A sinister, machinelike intelligence that lacked the restraints that bind the rest of us. (page 75)  \n\n> Gödel had shown him that if someone succeeded in creating a formal system of axioms that was free of all internal paradoxes and contradictions, it would always be incomplete, because it would contain truths and statements that—while being undeniably true—could never be proven within the laws of that system. Gödel had found what appeared to be an ontological limit, something that we could not think past. An unprovable truth is a mathematician’s nightmare, and it was a personal catastrophe for Jancsi, because it opened up a monumental rift that no future knowledge or theory could patch up. The philosophical implications of Gödel’s logic were astonishing, and his incompleteness theorems, as they later came to be known, are now considered a fundamental discovery, one that hints at the limits of human understanding. (page 81)  \n\n> One of his professors from the University of Vienna, who met him when he was a very young man, said that he could not figure out if it was the nature of his work that made him unstable, or if you actually had to be unstable to think in the way that Gödel did. I believe there is truth in both views. The few times I spoke to him, I could sense how logic and logical thinking were inextricably bound to his mounting derangement, because, in some sense, paranoia is logic run amok. “Every chaos is a wrong appearance,” wrote Gödel; he was of the firm belief that there was a reason for everything. If you think that way, it’s a small step to begin to see hidden machinations and agents operating to manipulate the most common, everyday occurrences. (page 85)  \n\n> Chess is not a game! It is a well-defined form of computation. You may not be able to work out the correct answers because of its complexity, but in theory there must be a solution, an optimal way to play, a perfect move for any given position and configuration of pieces on the board. Now, real games are not like that at all. Games in real life are very different. To win in reality you must lie and deceive. The games that I’m interested in consist of carefully elaborated tactics of deception—of self-deception even!—so you have to be constantly asking yourself what the other man is thinking, how you will respond, and what he thinks that you are going to do next. That is what games are about in my theory. (page 114)\n- on game theory with conflicts of interest \n\n> At the heart of our theory was his proof of the so-called minimax theorem: von Neumann had mathematically demonstrated that there is always a rational course of action for two-player games, provided (and herein lies the catch) that their interests are diametrically opposed. (page 117)  \n\n> Ulam … this guy was fabulously lazy, one of those strange scientists who are just perfectly brilliant and dazzlingly smart, but who can’t be bothered to do the work, or simply see no benefit in realizing their ideas. His story is incredible. Because, you see, he had a brain disease, he caught encephalitis and almost died. One night he woke up with a massive headache and when he tried to talk all he could do was mumble meaningless phrases. They rushed him to the hospital, drilled a hole in his brain, and pumped him full of penicillin and he fell into a coma. He should have died. He really should have. It’s a miracle that he made it and didn’t suffer massive brain damage or mental impairment, which is what the doctors told his wife. Actually, the opposite happened: he did some of his best work after that, and even came up with one of his biggest ideas when he was still convalescing. The doctors had told him that he really shouldn’t think too much. He should make an effort not to think at all. If he put too much strain on his brain, he could very well die. So what did this wonderful mathematician do? He started playing patience. Solitaire with cards. So he plays one hand after another with his mind on idle, almost completely unengaged. In patience, you really don’t have to think, do you? There are no choices to make, it’s almost fully automatic, and yet he began to spot a pattern—he came to see that he could predict, with at least some level of precision, the outcome of the game after just a few cards. So he analyzes that and comes up with the Monte Carlo method, which is essentially a computational algorithm, a way to make statistical guesses and solve complex problems not by actually working them out, but by making a series of random approximations. Say you want to know the probability of winning a game of patience with a particular shuffle of the pack: normally, you would have to sit down and calculate, look at the problem abstractly, but with Monte Carlo, you would play out a very large number of these games—say, a thousand games—and from those results you could simply observe and count the number of successful plays, and infer your answer from that information. Monte Carlo is a sort of weaponized randomness, a method to sift through overwhelming amounts of data in search of meaning, a way to make predictions and deal with uncertainty by modeling the many possible futures of complex situations and choose between the roads that branch out from ambiguous and unpredictable events. It’s unbelievably powerful and sort of humbling, or humiliating really, because it shows the limits of traditional calculation, of our rational and logical step-by-step thinking. It also turned out to be exactly the type of thing that the MANIAC needed to perform the enormous mathematical simulations and coupled hydro-dynamics necessary to confirm the feasibility of the Teller-Ulam hydrogen bomb design. (page 138)\n- Birth of the Monte Carlo resampling method \n\n> Monomania (page 140)\n- (n.) Derangement of the mind in regard of a single subject only; also, such a concentration of interest upon one particular subject or train of ideas to show mental derangement. \n\n> Thermonuclear weapons would have been almost impossible to create had it not been for von Neumann’s brainchild. The fate of that machine was tied to them from its inception, because the race to build the bomb was accelerated by Johnny’s desire to build his computer, and the push to build the MANIAC was hastened by the nuclear arms race. It’s scary how science works. Just think about this for a second: the most creative and the most destructive of human inventions arose at exactly the same time. So much of the high-tech world we live in today, with its conquest of space and extraordinary advances in biology and medicine, were spurred on by one man’s monomania and the need to develop electronic computers to calculate whether an H-bomb could be built or not. (page 140)\n- Computers were invented for the H-bomb \n\n> Something very small, so tiny and insignificant as to be almost invisible in its origin, can nonetheless open up a new and radiant perspective, because through it a higher order of being is trying to express itself. These unlikely happenings could be hidden all around us, lying in wait on the border of our awareness, or floating quietly amid the sea of information that we drown in, each one bearing the potential to bloom and irradiate violently, prying apart the floor-boards of this world to show us what lies beneath. I know this because I was part of the group of scientists that discovered the role that messenger RNA plays in all living cells. (page 149)\n- a word of warning \n\n> In his paper, he divided his theoretical construct—which he called the “automaton”—into three components: the functional part, a decoder that reads the instructions and builds the next copy, and a device that takes that information and inserts it into the new machine. The astounding thing is that right there, in that paper written in the late 1940s, he depicts the way in which DNA and RNA work, long before anyone had ever glimpsed the strange beauty of the double helix. The logical basis of all systems of self-replication is made so crystal clear by von Neumann that I can’t believe I wasn’t able to figure it out myself. I would have become an instant celebrity! (page 150)\n- automatons\n\n> But he didn’t stop there. He expanded on his paper and came up with what we now call a “von Neumann probe”: a self-building, self-repairing, and self-improving spacecraft that we could launch to colonize the outer planets of our solar system, and from there, blast off toward the darkest reaches of space. (page 151)\n\n> However wonderful, his thought experiment, like so many other things in science, could lead to disturbing scenarios. What would happen if, as is common in all processes of self-replication, one of his probes suffered a small mutation along the way? This minuscule error, this subtle mistake, could affect one of its core processes, modifying its characteristics and goals, and then spread along its future descendants, transforming this piece of technology in ways that are impossible to predict. It is chilling to think about what they could become as they voyage through the endless expanses of space with limitless time at their disposal. How far would they stray from their original programming? Would they become unresponsive, would they choose to remain on a single planet and develop there, quietly? Or would they become ravenous, a massive swarm consuming everything in its path, responding to a new set of goals, answering to intentions and purposes that went beyond simple discovery and exploration? And what if they decided to turn around and come back to us, to undo their million-year voyage and demand that we—their long-lost parents—forgive their deeds and provide an answer to that most pressing question, one that also haunts and tortures our own species: Why? Why did we create and abandon them? Why did we send them out into the dark? (page 151)  \n\n> they would need to be capable not only of error and of deviation from their original programming but also of random and even non-sensical behavior. Turing believed that such randomness would play an important part in intelligent machinery, because it allows for novel and unpredictable responses, creating a large variety of possibilities among which a search program could then find the appropriate action for each particular circumstance.  (page 153)\n- Turing on AI \n\n> Biological beings exist in wondrous disarray, caught in a dance so frantically complex that we may never fully comprehend it, no matter how hard we try, because that same harmony shapes and animates our own bodies and minds.

(page 192)\n- mathematics as an outflow of the mind's primordial \"programming language\" \n\n> For all these games, it considered no human experience: it was simply given the rules and allowed to play against itself. At first, it made completely random moves, but in next to no time it had evolved into an unbeatable force. It has now become the strongest entity the world has ever known at Go, chess, and shogi.

The wave function showed all those possibilities superimposed. Heisenberg had forgotten the entire accursed debate about particles and waves, and had once more clung to numbers to find his path. Analysing Schrödinger’s mathematics and his own, he had discovered that certain properties of a quantum object, such as its position and quantity of motion, were coupled, and the relationship between them evinced strange properties. The more precisely the one was identified, the more uncertain the other became. If, for example, the exact location of an electron was established with certainty, arresting that particle in its orbit like an insect impaled on a pin, then its velocity became utterly undefined; it might be immobile or moving at the speed of light, and there was no way of knowing which. The opposite was true as well. If the electron was endowed with a set quantity of motion, its position was so indeterminate that it might be in the palm of your hand or at the other end of the universe. These two variables were mathematically complementary: establishing the one dissolved the other. (page 119)  \n\n> was impossible to “see” a quantum entity for the simple reason that it did not have a single identity. Illuminating one of its properties necessarily obscured the other. The best description of a quantum system was neither an image nor a metaphor, but rather a set of numbers. (page 120)\n- wildly fascinating and related to my own thoughts on DETERMINISM \n\n> Reality, they said to those present, does not exist as something separate from the act of observation. A quantum object has no intrinsic properties. An electron is not in any fixed place until it is measured; it is only in that instant that it appears. Before being measured, it has no attributes; prior to observation, it cannot even be conceived of. It exists in a specific manner when it is detected by a specific instrument. Between one measurement and the next, there is no point in asking how it moves, what it is, or where it is located. Like the moon in Buddhism, a particle does not exist: it is the act of measuring that makes it a real object. (page 124)\n- i truly dont understand this and would ove to. \n\n> Schrödinger too came to detest quantum mechanics. He contrived an elaborate thought experiment, a Gedankenexperiment, the result of which was an apparently impossible creature: a cat that was, at once, alive and dead. His intention was to demonstrate the ridiculous character of this manner of thinking. The proponents of the Copenhagen Interpretation told Schrödinger that he was absolutely right: the result was not only ridiculous, but paradoxical. And yet it was true. Schrödinger’s cat, like any elementary particle, was alive and dead (at least until it was measured), and the Austrian’s name would remain associated forever with this failed attempt to negate the ideas he himself had helped give rise to. Schrödinger made contributions to biology, genetics, thermodynamics and general relativity, but never again produced anything comparable to what he had done during the six months following his stay in Villa Herwig, nor did he ever return there. (page 128)\n- schrodingers cat \n\n> The night gardener told me that the man who invented modern-day nitrogen fertilizers—a German chemist called Fritz Haber—was also the first man to create a weapon of mass destruction, namely chlorine gas, which he poured into the trenches of the First World War. His green gas killed thousands and made countless soldiers claw at their throats as the poison boiled inside their lungs, drowning them in their own vomit and phlegm, while his fertilizer, which he harvested from the nitrogen present in the air itself, saved hundreds of millions from famine and fuelled our current overpopulation. Today nitrogen is more than plentiful, but in centuries past wars were fought over bird and bat shit, and thieves ransacked the bones of the Egyptian pharaohs to steal the nitrogen hidden in their bones. According to the night gardener, the Mapuche Indians would crush the skeletons of their vanquished enemies and spread that dust on their farms as fertilizer, always working in the dead of night, when the trees are fast asleep, for they believed that some of them—the canelo and the araucaria, the monkey puzzle—could see into a warrior’s soul, steal his deepest secrets and spread them through the shared roots of the forest, where plush tendrils whispered to pale mushroom mycelium, ruining his standing before the community. His secret life lost, exposed and bared to the world, the man would slowly begin to shrivel, drying up from the inside out, without ever knowing why. (page 137)\n- nitrogen and chlorine gas guy \n\n> The night gardener used to be a mathematician, and now speaks of mathematics as former alcoholics speak of booze, with a mixture of fear and longing. (page 142)\n- LOL \n\n> Take quantum mechanics, the crown jewel of our species, the most accurate, far-ranging and beautiful of all our physical theories. It lies behind the supremacy of our smartphones, behind the Internet, behind the coming promise of godlike computing power. It has completely reshaped our world. We know how to use it, it works as if by some strange miracle, and yet there is not a human soul, alive or dead, who actually gets it. The mind cannot come to grips with its paradoxes and contradictions. It’s as if the theory had fallen to earth from another planet, and we simply scamper around it like apes, toying and playing with it, but with no true understanding. (page 143)\n- wow..",

(page 9)\n- answer: the mirror phase. Imagine a mirror which shows the Other instead of yourself, this would mae u atart idetfying as that other. \n\n> Crucial to Lacan’s programme of a return to Freud is the distinction between signifier and signified. According to a well-known definition, a signifier is an acoustic image (like a word), a signified is a concept. The signified has a kind of priority and we use signifiers to gain access to signifieds: or, put more simply, to say what we mean. A word gives us access to a meaning. The passage from word to meaning seems simple enough. We can ask for some object, the listener will understand our meaning and respond with the object. Language is thus all about communicating with each other. We use words to convey meanings and intentions. (page 12)\n- communication: signified encoded in signifier, signifier decoded to signified. in wht ways can the 2 versions of the signiied differ? \n\n> But Lacan saw things differently. Rather than supposing a transparency between signifier and signified, an easy access from word to meaning, he claimed there was a real barrier, a resistance. (page 12)  \n\n> The group of meanings is organized by the links between the words. There is thus a priority of the signifier, of the material, verbal element in psychic life. (page 12)\n- there is a difference btwn what u want fo say and what u say BEYOND misunderstanding between 2 ppl, is what theyre trying to say. the person speaking may inend to say sth different from what they think they intend. very muc in line with my ow feelings towards how i think many thougjts are rationalizations after the fact \n\n> Signifiers form I networks to which we have little conscious access but which will affect our lives completely. They organize our world, the very texture of which is symbolic. (page 13)\n- ties into pirsigs value structures as the bleeding edge of reality or his analytic knife \n\n> The Ideal (page 13)\n- ie the child interpretes the image (signified) as a symbol (the signifier) \n\n> mirror phase. If Lacan had first stressed the imaginary identification, he now discussed its symbolic side. If the child is captured in an image, he or she will still assume signifiers from the speech of the parents as elements of identification. (page 13)\n- ie how does the child assume the signiiers in the images it identifies with(ie is captured by). \n\n> the subject has “become“ what a parent prophesied (page 14)\n- idntification with the ideal \n\n> The key to the theory of identification here is that symbolic identification with an ideal element removes the subject from being completely at the mercy of the imaginary images which captivate him or her. They come from another register, the symbolic, and thus serve to ground the subject, to give him a base, in this structure. (page 14)  \n\n> the ideal ego is the image you assume and the ego ideal is the symbolic point which gives you a place and supplies the point from which you are looked at. (page 14)\n- does it make sense to ask: who am i tryna be? looking at my parents. \n\n> A word is a word because it is different from other words: “cat” has its value because it is different from “mat”, “fat” and “cot”, for example. Or, to move outside the realm of spoken language, a railway network can perfectly well count as a linguistic system since the 10.30 train will still be the 10.30 train even if it arrives at 10.40, precisely because it is different from the 10.00 train and the 11.00 train. It takes on its value because it is an element in a system of differences. (page 15)\n- structuralist linguistics \n\n> tween elements. The 10.30, 11.00 and 10.00 trains do not all arrive at the same time and they are not all superimposed on the railway timetable.

Remember that all that children really know about their internal organs is what their parents tell them. The inside of their body is thus made up of words. (page 16)  \n\n> a symptom is made up of words.

(page 16)\n- it being the symptom. as merely a symptom it is isolated from the other words in the linguistic web. repressed word=symptom \n\n> The dimension of discontinuity and rupture introduced by the variability of the length of the sessions was thus effective in generating the most hidden material. (page 17)\n- bc variability makes preparation moe difficult and allows ending session on importnt concepts so the patients can do most of the work themseves \n\n> If language is a structure, speech is an act, generating meaning as it is spoken and giving an identity to the speakers involved. (page 18)\n- speech gives one a place \n\n> And if recognition is seen as central to a theory of how speech works, it supposes the existence of an Other, a place from which you are heard, from which you are recognized. (page 18)  \n\n> He calls the real, the symbolic and the imaginary the “three registers of human reality”. Thus, what we ordinarily speak of as “reality” would best be defined as an amalgam of symbolic and imaginary: imaginary to the extent that we are situated in the specular register and the ego offers us rationalizations of our actions; and symbolic to the extent that most things around us have meaning. (page 18)  \n\n> The real would represent precisely what is excluded from our reality, the margin of what is without meaning and which we fail to situate or explore. (page 18)  \n\n> 1950s, Lacan saw the image as the central source of resistance in psychoanalytic treatment. The ego is made up of privileged images and the task of analysis is to dissolve them. They must be integrated in speech and the symbolic network, rather than remaining stagnant and inert, blocking the dialectical progression of speech. (page 19)\n- these privilegwd images are idealizations of our own idetity obtained through the captivity in images that allows us to learn to function in early childhood. \n\n> Understanding what someone is saying must come after this. (page 19)  \n\n> obsessional, (page 20)\n- i feel like the main trouble in understanding this is the fact i don't know what obsessional refers to in a psychoanalytic context. \n\n> indicate to the subject the place of the ego and to turn the stagnatory images which captivate him into part of the associative material. (page 21)\n- the subject is simply the person, the ego is a subconscious part of their mind which contain false identifications with others which may lead to conflict in their discordance with the subject's reality. \n\n> An initial situation – such as the details of the marriage of one’s parents – would be transformed into certain rules in one’s own life, completely unconsciously, to generate situations – such as one’s own marriage or love life – which both repeated the initial situation and transformed it in important ways. (page 21)  \n\n> Paternity has a symbolic side to it, and Lacan called this agency of paternity the name of the father. It is not a real person but a symbolic function. (page 22)\n- paternity is the signifier for the signified: the name of the father, which is paternity's symbolic meaning. \n\n> Oedipus complex (page 22)\n- young boy unconsciously desires to have sex with his mother and disdain his father for having sex and being satisfied before him \n\n> Once this triangular structure is established, the child can try, with the many games of seduction that children are so good at, to become this third term, the object of the mother’s desire. It is an attempt to be the phallus for the mother, to incarnate the phallus in whatever form is particular to the individuals in question. (page 23)\n- i guess in a way the child desires to be the primary desire of the mother, whose primary desire is the phallus, or the father. In 2023, we could perhaps rephrase the phallus to the partner? \n\n> He or she will be able to leave the universe of the mother to take on a place in the larger universe of the symbolic world. The imaginary object must take on the value of a gift, and hence the crucial time of the Oedipus complex will involve establishing this new signification. The phallus will be the object promised to the child for use in the future, it will become the object of a pact. (page 23)  \n\n> Symbolic Network (page 23)\n- im curious to find out if, for the child to leave the triangular mother-phallus structure, the mother must gift the child something? \n\n> Is Lacan a Structuralist? (page 23)  \n\n> Lacan is thus hardly a structuralist. Structuralism aimed to do away with the subject and the notion of subjective agency, putting in its place the autonomy of linguistic structures. As Jacques-Alain Miller has pointed out, although Lacan shares this conception of the autonomy of the symbolic, he is deeply concerned at the same time, to find a place for the subject here. (page 23)  \n\n> The early work referred to alienation in the register of the image, and now alienation is situated in the register of language. If speech was first seen as giving the subject some sort of identity, now language has the role of blocking identity. This is the difference between Lacan’s conception of language in 1953 and that of 1958: the subject is no longer recognized but abolished. (page 24)  \n\n> Loss and Language (page 24)\n- the fact you asked for it creates a risk: my request for water is seen as a sign of love if honoured, but a sign of rejection if it is not honoured. \n\n> If someone asks you if you love them and you say yes, that will not stop them from asking you again and again and again. The impossibility of really proving one’s love once and for all is well known.  (page 24)  \n\n> need and demand, he adds the register of desire. Desire takes up what has been eclipsed at the level of need (the dimension represented by the mythical water) and introduces an absolute condition in opposition to the absolutely unconditional nature of demand. (page 24)\n- demand is unconditional, and desire introduces an opposite absolute condition to it: what does that mean? \n\n> … (page 24)\n- desire being absolute and unconditional \n\n> If demand is demand for an object, desire has nothing as its object: nothing in the sense of “lack taken as an object”. Some clinical structures show the difference clearly. The anorexic, for example, in refusing to eat gives a place to desire beyond demand. To the mother’s demand for the child to eat, the latter offers a symbolic refusal, maintaining a desire centering on the “nothing” which is eaten. (page 25)\n- it seems the demand is made by someone else, leading to later desire the opposite thing to the demand. \n\n> Freud had shown that when an unconscious current is repressed, since it cannot enter consciousness, it displaces itself on to tiny details and it is only in following these derivatives that we will mobilize the rest of the complex in question. (page 25)\n- freudian slips \n\n> It is important to distinguish what Lacan calls desire from what we would ordinarily call a wish. A wish is something you want consciously. But desire is fundamentally barred from consciousness. (page 25)\n- was the colloquialism \"secret desire\" introduced by freud? \n\n> Desire is simply equivalent to the process of distortion which has turned the wish for shelter and food into this particular image, these particular details. If you dream of passing an exam in a certain place the night before sitting a real exam, desire is more likely to be found not in the idea of passing the exam (a wish) than in the detail of the place in question (why this place rather than another?). (page 26)  \n\n> You say one thing instead of something else and you do not know why. Desire is present because one element has been distorted and modified by another one. We can deduce the presence of desire in clinical work by paying attention to these processes as they repeat themselves and to the points of rupture, distortion and opacity in a patient’s associations. (page 26)  \n\n> The neurotic wants, in Lacan’s terms, to be the phallus for the mother. The child is searching for some object, but it is a lost one, as the intervention of the father in the Oedipus complex prevents the child from assimilating itself with the object of the mother’s demand. The intervention of the father distances the child from the mother, it gives the child possibilities of leaving the universe of the mother. And it situates the phallus as something lost, forever out of reach. It says “No” both to the child and to the mother. (page 27)\n- the mother demands the phallus, and the child wants to be it, but cannot find it bc of the fathers intervention. the remaining struggle creates the neurotic person. \n\n> The child is at the mercy of the mother at the start of life, dependent on her in all senses of the word, and unable to understand the rationale of her behaviour. However marvellous or cruel the mother may be, the same question will pose itself for the child, a question which concerns him or her to the quick: what does she want? (page 27)  \n\n> If, however, the mother does show that her life is not completely reduced to the child, things are otherwise. The child is confronted with a series of questions about the mother’s movements and whims. Lacan argues that there is an operation which will link all these enigmas about the mother to a precise signification, that of the phallus. (page 28)  \n\n> There is always something beyond the child to which the mother’s desire is directed. This, Lacan argues, is the phallus, something forever out of the child’s reach and beyond its own capacities to incarnate. (page 28)  \n\n> If the Oedipal process works properly, the child will give this up, the phallus becoming less an imaginary object than a signification of what is missing. (page 28)\n- right so, child wants to be the thing that mother desires (the phallus), but it cant, which is a loss? \n\n> The game shows how language works, how the initial element is altered, the circle of children incarnating the network of language. Lacan argues that the symbol of this process of distortion is the phallus. (page 30)\n- game of chinese whispers \n\n> There is always this disassociation between the real side of paternity and its symbolic side. (page 30)\n- but doesnt literally the same thing happen for maternity? ie biologically giving birth vs motherhood \n\n> It is by her speech that the mother situates a reference to a father who is beyond her, which need not be identical with the real father, as long as it serves to separate mother and child. Lacan calls this structural, symbolic element the name of the father. (page 30)  \n\n> The Oedipal operation is called by Lacan the “paternal metaphor”. It is a metaphor since it involves the substitution of one term for another, the name of the father for the desire of the mother. (page 30)  \n\n> Hence, a child might try to be everything for its mother. (page 31)  \n\n> The child is trying to be the object which it thinks the mother lacks. The phallus is just the name for this object: that which the mother lacks. Once this definition is accepted, it can be noted in a very wide range of clinical forms. (page 31)\n- its so comical in a way. like who on earth bred ths weird naming system \n\n> This is castration, the renunciation of the sustained attempt to be the phallus for the mother. Neurotics are people who have unfortunately not committed themselves to this renunciation. (page 31)\n- B \n\n> essay “On a Question Preliminary to Any Possible Treatment of Psychosis”. (page 32)\n- E \n\n> Psychosis (page 32)\n- theres an interesting thought pattern here of psycoss filling some kin of purpose. would be interesting to link to isigs comments on psychosis \n\n> In other words, a delusion can serve as a way of giving sense to the menacing world around one, made menacing precisely by the absence of certain fundamental significations to give an order to it. (page 33)\n- the name of the father gives sense to the world is whag this seems to imply. and secondly the oedipus complex is th standard delusion? \n\n> Thus, just as Freud had argued that a delusion is an attempt at self-cure, Lacan saw it as a secondary effect, an attempt to provide a meaning to the primary problematic of foreclosure. (page 33)  \n\n> Thus delusions use the knowledge of the time to provide meanings, a fact which is seen in the change in delusional motifs from one epoch to another. (page 33)\n- B. very true \n\n> What seems incomprehensible and irrational in psychotic behaviour may turn out to make perfect sense, once the implicit logic is brought out. (page 34)  \n\n> the set of linguistic elements and their otherness is given the symbol (A) by Lacan.  (page 34)\n- ie potential signifiers who have not been recognized by the child yet \n\n> Significations are gradually set in place for the child, as he or she gradually manages to associate meanings with the signifiers emitted by the adults: whether these are “right” or “wrong” is irrelevant. (page 34)\n- significations = meanings \n\n> Symbol d and $ ￼ D (page 34)\n- meaning in my own words: some linguistic elements remain unexplained, even unexplained by WRONG significations. the child simply has no clue what to make of those. \n\n> S (￼) indicates the fact that ultimately there is no solution to the question of what we do not understand at the level of language. There are no words to respond to the central questions of sex and existence. Whatever the parents tell the child about these things, the child knows that what they say is inadequate. S(￼) designates this point of impossibility. But Lacan does not simply write (￼), which would refer to a gap in the Other, in the set of linguistic elements. Instead there is S plus a “barred” (￼), indicating, paradoxically, that there is a signifier of the very impossibility of signifying something – a marker pointing to an impossibility. (page 35)\n- o, i cant help but see the resemblance between signifiers and pointers in languages like C. \n\n> Note that all of these objects are used in games or rituals with the mother. The breast can be turned towards and then turned away from (refusal to eat). Excrement can be retained or expelled. The look can be hidden or shown (peekaboo). The voice can be absent or made terribly present as in the prolonged screaming of many children. Thus all these elements become involved in games of presence and absence, a sign that they are linked into the symbolic and the system of differences. (page 36)  \n\n> objects (page 37)\n- objects can be non physical ie look and voie \n\n> Language does not provide us with a proper identity: the words we use are used by other people, on television, in books, in the media. The words do not belong to us. They are alienating. Even when we want to say something intimate, linked to our heart, like “I love you”, we might be inhibited because we have heard so many other people say this. (page 38)\n- oof. this is what cringe is: these words have been used by annoying people, i dont want to assume a similar identity \n\n> Formula for Phantasy (page 38)\n- also a reminder fr me that this whole thing is about the process from a helpless newborn to A SPEAKING BEING \n\n> Now, once this basic phantasy is established, the child has a sort of compass or rule for his or her life. Lacan calls it an “absolute signification”. (page 38)\n- remember that the phantasy answers \"if im not the phallus, what am i?\" \n\n> The phantasy is a sort of magnet which will attract those memories to itself which suit it. Likewise, it will play a large part in determining your unconscious identifications. (page 38)  \n\n> Lacan’s comparison serves to distinguish two different positions of the analyst: the one aiming at the good, at regulating problems; and the other, much more frightening, at remaining true to desire. (page 39)\n- i dont understand the significance of desire yet \n\n> In 1963, Lacan was struck off the list of training analysts of the Société Française de Psychanalyse (SFP). His practice and theoretical elaboration were seen as too threatening and challenging for those who opposed him in the established hierarchy, the International Psychoanalytic Association. As a result, he left St-Anne Hospital, the usual venue for his seminars, to move to the École Normale Supérieur, the élite higher education establishment in Paris which has produced generation after generation of France’s intellectuals. (page 40)\n- this illustrates very well just how controversial he was \n\n> Transference involves, in part, the attribution of a subject to this knowledge, so that the patient realizes that there is a knowledge he or she is separated from and then assumes that this knowledge has a knowing subject, identified with the analyst. (page 40)\n- B \n\n> But, as Lacan shows, there is another side to transference which involves something opposed to knowledge, the object a. The more the subject is alienated in language, the more his words are uttered faster than he intends, the more slips he makes: in other words, the more he is losing himself in free association (page 41)\n- right, so the object a being the phantasy, which is outside of language and which can be used as an anchoring point, the easier it becomes to tap into thw unconscious thrpugh free association \n\n> Lacan’s work in the 1960s became increasingly concerned with trying to formulate a logic of what he called jouissance, a word which is in fact part of English literary heritage, appearing in Edmund Spenser’s Faerie Queene and other writing of the 16th century. (page 41)\n- thats pretty smug... \n\n> Jouissance is felt 99 per cent of the time as unbearable suffering. (page 41)  \n\n> making the same mistakes, the same ill-starred decisions throughout their lives which bring them pain and grief. (page 42)  \n\n> And, crucially for psychoanalysis, in symptoms. A symptom, something in mind or body which intrudes into your life and brings you misery, represents a portion of jouissance which has not been dislodged, which has come back to disrupt your existence. (page 43)\n- bc as u grow older, laws and rules of the social world drain u of ur jouissance \n\n> not the closure of one’s relation to psychoanalysis. (page 43)  \n\n> Jacques-Alain Miller has shown how these considerations led Lacan to a new formulation of castration: the emptying out of jouissance from the body. And what is the agent of this castration? The symbolic register as such: language. The organism’s passage through and into language is castration, introducing the idea of loss and absence into the world. (page 43)\n- B. buried in an individuals signifier chain, lie the remnants of the castration complex \n\n> there is a side to language which is itself a form of jouissance. (page 45)\n- jouissance is insufferable pain to which you are attracted, and which is the remnant of being born into the castration complex. some ppl dont lose it like adults usually do when they grow older \n\n> In his book Totem and Taboo, Freud had argued that at the mythic origin of society lay a primal horde, in which a jealous and greedy father enjoyed all the women. (page 45)  \n\n> If Freud’s story in Totem and Taboo was a myth, Lacan tries to extract a logical structure from it and he gives notation for the sexuality. (page 45)\n- the law of prohibition ie the idea that none but the father can have all the women. the logical structue is the fact  that onky one escapes. \n\n> As Lacan pointed out there is no myth in the analytic literature like that contained in Totem and Taboo about female sexuality. According to Lacan, women participate in a logic very different from that of the man. (page 45)  \n\n> Men and women are both subject to the imposition of the symbolic order and the networks of signifiers. (page 45)\n- as in, the order of significations imposed on us 1) being born human 2) into a certain mythos 3) to specific parents? \n\n> Now, although these formulas seem amazingly abstract and distant from the world of clinical practice, they are not. If sexuality involves a sort of materialization of these structures in the associations brought by the patient, one can understand much of the data precisely as an attempt to introduce the formulas to which Lacan had given logical form. (page 46)\n- okay so a big problem i have with lcans theories is that this is the classification model you get with Lacan's sample. How different would his theories be if his patients had been different people? What would its standard error be?  \n\n> Although this child was caught in a world in which the Oedipal complex was hardly standard, (page 46)\n- bc these tyrants the child identifies with are not subject to the oedipus complex, they are the exceptions \n\n> Their elaboration shows Lacan’s constant preoccupation with finding ways of formalising psychic processes. (page 46)\n- G \n\n> If the unconscious is made up of relations between signifiers, there must be an order or structure imposed on them, which holds them together and organizes their relations. A signifier is a discrete element, different from other signifiers, and so may be taken as a component of a set. Now, a space is a set, a set of points, and hence a network of signifiers would constitute a space. Since mathematics offers many ways of investigating the properties of spaces, it was in this direction that Lacan moved. (page 46)  \n\n> what keeps things in place, more or less, is the name of the father. This binds things together and guarantees, in some sense, the Oedipus complex. But now Lacan argues that it is less the name of the father as such that really matters than any element or device that can bind together the three orders of the real, the symbolic and the imaginary. There is thus a sort of functionalism at work in Lacan’s argument. (page 47)\n- the first part is important in understanding this \n\n> Knots (page 47)\n- take img  on prev page \n\n> Objects may be used or invented to bind together elements of the body image (the imaginary), linguistic or computer circuitry (the symbolic), and extreme excitation or pain (the real). (page 47)\n- useful definitions \n\n> This formulation is of great interest clinically since it allows one to understand the delusional constructions and inventions, in all senses of the word, of a psychosis. These may serve to bind together the real, the symbolic and the imaginary. Thus the well-known presence of machines, computers and products of science in certain psychotic systems may be explained in a new way. Objects may be used or invented to bind together elements of the body image (the imaginary), linguistic or computer circuitry (the symbolic), and extreme excitation or pain (the real). A successful psychotic system may thus be considered as a knot or, indeed, as a proper name, which ties together the three orders. We can see how Lacan is thus dealing with clinical considerations, especially given the fact that an understanding of this use of knots can give invaluable help in guiding work with psychotic patients. (page 47)  \n\n> Lacan gives a new name to the element which can serve to bind the three orders of real, symbolic and imaginary. He calls it the “sinthome”, a word play in French which includes references to “symptom”’, “saint” and “Saint Thomas” (page 47)  \n\n> The theory of “sinthome” suggests that such subjects have found a way of knotting the real, the imaginary and the symbolic. Lacan investigated such knottings in the year-long seminar he gave on James Joyce in 1975–6. Joyce, he argued, would be an example of such a structure. His writing bound together the registers and he became the sinthome himself in the promotion of his own name. (page 48)  \n\n> In Britain, the Centre for Freudian Analysis and Research provides seminars on Lacanian psychoanalysis with many speakers from Europe and beyond, and offers a training in Lacanian psychoanalysis (www.cfar.org.uk). (page 48)  \n\n> Lacan published his famous collection of articles, Écrits in 1966 (Norton, New York, 1977). There is an English version of part of the text Écrits: A Selection, (Norton, New York, 1977), but the translation is poor and this makes it a difficult place to start. Much more accessible are the translations of Lacan’s seminars. These have been edited by Jacques-Alain Miller, and at present five have appeared in translation under the general title The Seminars of Jacques Lacan: (page 50)  \n\n> Slavoj ￼ek’s books The Sublime Object of Ideology (Verso, London, 1989) and Looking Awry: An Introduction to Lacan through Popular Culture (MIT Press, 1991) are also interesting and illuminating books in the field.

He would see only one kind of behavior—possibly a steady state, possibly a seven-year cycle, possibly apparent randomness. He would have no way of knowing that the same system, with some slight change in some parameter, could display patterns of a completely different kind.”\n(78)\n\n[How long is the coast of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Long_Is_the_Coast_of_Britain?_Statistical_Self-Similarity_and_Fractional_Dimension)\nMandelbrot paper\n(96)\n![[Great Britain Coastline Paradox.gif]]\n\n“Common sense suggests that, although these estimates will continue to get larger, they will approach some particular final value, the true length of the coastline. The measurements should converge, in other words. And in fact, if a coastline were some Euclidean shape, such as a circle, this method of summing finer and finer straight-line distances would indeed converge. But Mandelbrot found that as the scale of measurement becomes smaller, the measured length of a coastline rises without limit, bays and peninsulas revealing ever-smaller subbays and subpeninsulas—at least down to atomic scales, where the process does finally come to an end. Perhaps” (101)\n\nMy age old belief that lines and equations can describe the whole world is shattered by fractal geometry…\n> Geophysicists looked at surfaces the way anyone would, as shapes. A surface might be flat. Or it might have a particular shape. You could look at the outline of a Volkswagen Beetle, for example, and draw that surface as a curve. The curve would be measurable in familiar Euclidean ways. You could fit an equation to it. \n\nBut you can’t…\n\n“The claim was that the degree of irregularity remains constant over different scales. Surprisingly often, the claim turns out to be true. Over and over again, the world displays a regular irregularity.” (103)\n\n“Self-similarity is an easily recognizable quality. Its images are everywhere in the culture: in the infinitely deep reflection of a person standing between two mirrors, or in the cartoon notion of a “fish eating a smaller fish eating a smaller fish eating a smaller fish. Mandelbrot likes to quote Jonathan Swift: “So, Nat’ralists observe, a Flea/Hath smaller Fleas that on him prey,/And these have smaller Fleas to bite ’em,/ And so proceed ad infinitum.” (108)\n\n“Geophysicists looked at surfaces the way anyone would, as shapes. A surface might be flat. Or it might have a particular shape. You could look at the outline of a Volkswagen Beetle, for example, and draw that surface as a curve. The curve would be measurable in familiar Euclidean ways. You could fit an equation to it. But in Scholz’s description, you would only be looking at that surface through a narrow spectral band. It would be like looking at the universe through a red filter—you see what is happening at that particular wavelength of light, but you miss everything happening at the wavelengths of other colors, not to mention that vast range of activity at parts of the spectrum corresponding to infrared radiation or radio waves. The spectrum, in this analogy, corresponds to scale. To think of the surface of a Volkswagen in terms of its Euclidean shape is to see it only on the scale of an observer ten meters or one hundred meters away. What about an observer one kilometer away, or one hundred kilometers? What about an observer one millimeter away, or one micron?”(111)\n\n“DNA surely cannot specify the vast number of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli or the particular spatial structure of the resulting tree, but it can specify a repeating process of bifurcation and development.”(116)\n\n## Attractors and phase-space\n“The strange attractor lives in phase space, one of the most powerful inventions of modern science. Phase space gives a way of turning numbers into pictures, abstracting every bit of essential information from a system of moving parts, mechanical or fluid, and making a flexible road map to all its possibilities. Physicists already worked with two simpler kinds of “attractors”: fixed points and limit cycles, representing behavior that reached a steady state or repeated itself continuously.\nIn phase space the complete state of knowledge about a dynamical system at a single instant in time collapses to a point. That point is the dynamical system—at that instant. At the next instant, though, the system will have changed, ever so slightly, and so the point moves. The history of the system time can be charted by the moving point, tracing its orbit through phase space with the passage of time.”(146)\n\n“Phase-space portraits of physical systems exposed patterns of motion that were invisible otherwise, as an infrared landscape photograph can reveal patterns and details that exist just beyond the reach of perception. When a scientist looked at a phase portrait, he could use his imagination to think back to the system itself. This loop corresponds to that periodicity. This twist corresponds to that change. This empty void corresponds to that physical impossibility.”(147)\n\n“Each attractor has its “basin,” just as two nearby rivers have their own watershed regions.\nIn the short term any point in phase space can stand for a possible behavior of the dynamical system. In the long term the only possible behaviors are the attractors themselves. Other kinds of motion are transient. By definition, attractors had the important property of stability—in a real system, where moving parts are subject to bumps and jiggles from real-world noise, motion tends to return to the attractor. A bump may shove a trajectory away for a brief time, but the resulting transient motions die out. Even if the cat knocks into it, a pendulum clock does not switch to a sixty-two–second minute.”(151)\n\n“The boundary between two or more attractors in a dynamical system served as a threshold of a kind that seems to govern so many ordinary processes, from the breaking of materials to the making of decisions. Each attractor in such a system has its basin, as a river has a watershed basin that drains into it. Each basin has a boundary. For an influential group in the early 1980s, a most promising new field of mathematics and physics was the study of fractal basin boundaries.” (240)\n\n“So Shaw began by explaining attractors in phase space: first fixed points (where everything stops); then limit cycles (where everything oscillates); then strange attractors (everything else).” (p. 277)\n- Fixed points, limit cycles, strange attractors\n\n**Quantifying strange attractors:**\n“Many mathematical peculiarities had to be sorted and understood. **Fractal dimension, Hausdorff dimension, Lyapunov dimension, information dimension**—the subtleties of these measures of a chaotic system were best explained by Farmer and Yorke. An attractor’s dimension was “the first level of knowledge necessary to characterize its properties.” It was the feature that gave “the amount of information necessary to specify the position of a point on the attractor to within a given accuracy.” (279)\n\n**Lorenz attractor:**\n“Lorenz’s stripped-down system of fluid convection was three-dimensional, not because the fluid moved through three dimensions, but because it took three distinct numbers to nail down the state of the fluid at any instant.”(147)\n- [[Lorenz attractor]]\n\n“He spent several nights in that basement, watching the green dot of the oscilloscope flying around the screen, tracing over and over the characteristic owl’s mask of the Lorenz attractor. The flow of the shape stayed on the retina, a flickering, fluttering thing, unlike any object Shaw’s research had shown him. It seemed to have a life of its own. It held the mind just as a flame does, by running in patterns that never repeat. The imprecision and not-quite–repeatability of the analog computer worked to Shaw’s advantage. He quickly saw the sensitive dependence on initial conditions that persuaded Edward Lorenz of the futility of longterm weather forecasting. He would set the initial conditions, push the go button, and off the attractor would go. Then he would set the same initial conditions again—as close as physically possible—and the orbit would sail merrily away from its previous course, yet end up on the same attractor.”(253)\n\n“The two-body problem is easy. Newton solved it completely. Each body—the earth and the moon, for example—travels in a perfect ellipse around the system’s joint center of gravity. Add just one more gravitational object, however, and everything changes. The three-body problem is hard, and worse than hard. As Poincaré discovered, it is most often impossible. The orbits can be calculated numerically for a while, and with powerful computers they can be tracked for a long while before uncertainties begin to take over. But the equations cannot be solved analytically, which means that long-term questions about a three-body system cannot be answered. Is the solar system stable? It certainly appears to be, in the short term, but even today no one knows for sure that some planetary orbits could not become more and more eccentric until the planets fly off from the system forever.” (158)\n- [[Three-body problem]]\n\n“No one realized it then, but Lorenz had looked at the same equation in 1964, as a metaphor for a deep question about climate. The question was so deep that almost no one had thought to ask it before: Does a climate exist? That is, does the earth’s weather have a long-term average? Most meteorologists, then as now, took the answer for granted. Surely any measurable behavior, no matter how it fluctuates, must have an average. Yet on reflection, it is far from obvious. As Lorenz pointed out, the average weather for the last 12,000 years has been notably different than the average for the previous 12,000, when most of North America was covered by ice. Was there one climate that changed to another for some physical reason? Or is there an even longer-term climate within which those periods were just fluctuations? Or is it possible that a system like the weather may never converge to an average? \n“Like May, Lorenz first examined what happened as the equation was iterated, given some parameter. With low parameters he saw the equation reaching a stable fixed point. There, certainly, the system produced a “climate” in the most trivial sense possible—the “weather” never changed. With higher parameters he saw the possibility of oscillation between two points, and there, too, the system converged to a simple average. But beyond a certain point, Lorenz saw that chaos ensues. Since he was thinking about climate, he asked not only whether continual feedback would produce periodic behavior, but also what the average output would be. And he recognized that the answer was that the average, too, fluctuated unstably. When the parameter value was changed ever so slightly, the average might change dramatically. By analogy, the earth’s climate might never settle reliably into an equilibrium with average long-term behavior.”(178)\n- Source: “The Problem of Deducing the Climate from the Governing Equations,” Tellus 16 (1964), pp. 1–11.”\n- Scale-dependence\n- Unstable, fluctuating, continuous changing average when changing the (time)scale. \n\n**White earth:**\n“Climatologists who use global computer models to simulate the long-term behavior of the earth’s atmosphere and oceans have known for several years that their models allow at least one dramatically different equilibrium. During the entire geological past, this alternative climate has never existed, but it could be an equally valid solution to the system of equations governing the earth. It is what some climatologists call the White Earth climate: an earth whose continents are covered by snow and whose oceans are covered by ice. A glaciated earth would reflect seventy percent of the incoming solar radiation and so would stay extremely cold. The lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, would be much thinner. The storms that would blow across the frozen surface would be much smaller than the storms we know. In general, the climate would be less hospitable to life as we know it. Computer models have such a strong tendency to fall into the White Earth equilibrium that climatologists find themselves wondering why it has never come about. It may simply be a matter of chance.”(180)\n\nA constant implies scaling, it can be inferred when variables converge geometrically. (172)\n\n**Scientific progress / metascience:**\n“Each scientist had a private constellation of intellectual parents. Each had his own picture of the landscape of ideas, and each picture was limited in its own way. Knowledge was imperfect. Scientists were biased by the customs of their disciplines or by the accidental paths of their own educations. The scientific world can be surprisingly finite. No committee of scientists pushed history into a new channel—a handful of individuals did it, with individual perceptions and individual goals.”(192)\n\n“In science, on the whole, physical cause dominates. Indeed, as astronomy and physics emerged from the shadow of religion, no small part of the pain came from discarding arguments by design, forward-looking teleology—the earth is what it is so that humanity can do what it does. In biology, however, Darwin firmly established **teleology** as the central mode of thinking about cause. The biological world may not fulfill God’s design, but it fulfills a design shaped by **natural selection**”(210)\n\n“Outside of computers, to find a strange attractor in a fluid experiment remained a serious challenge. It occupied experimenters like Harry Swinney well into the 1980s. And when the experimenters finally succeeded, the new computer experts often belittled their results as just the rough, predictable echoes of the magnificently detailed pictures their graphics terminals were already churning out. In a computer experiment, when you generated your thousands or millions of data points, patterns made themselves more or less apparent. In a laboratory, as in the real world, useful information had to be distinguished from noise. In a computer experiment data flowed like wine from a magic chalice. In a laboratory experiment you had to fight for every drop.”(219)\n\n## Information theory / entropy\n- [[Information theory and entropy]]\n“THE MOST CHARACTERISTICALLY Santa Cruzian imprint on chaos research involved a piece of mathematics cum philosophy known as information theory, invented in the late 1940s by a researcher at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Claude Shannon. Shannon called his work “The Mathematical Theory of Communication,” but it concerned a rather special quantity called information, and the name information theory stuck. The theory was a product of the electronic age. Communication lines and radio transmissions were carrying a certain thing, and computers would soon be storing this same thing on punch cards or magnetic cylinders, and the thing was neither knowledge nor meaning. Its basic units were not ideas or concepts or even, necessarily, words or numbers. This thing could be sense or nonsense—but the engineers and mathematicians could measure it, transmit it, and test the transmission for accuracy. Information proved as good a word as any, but people had to remember that they were using a specialized value-free term without the usual connotations of facts, learning, wisdom, understanding, enlightenment.”(263)\n\n“To Shannon, the right way to look at such patterns was this: a stream of data in ordinary language is less than random; each new bit is partly constrained by the bits before; thus each new bit carries somewhat less than a bit’s worth of real information. There was a hint of paradox floating in this formulation. The more random a data stream, the more information would be conveyed by each new bit.\"\n\n“The concept is easier to grasp intuitively than to measure in any real-life situation. What would be a reliable test for the level of mixing of two substances? One could imagine counting the molecules of each in some sample. But what if they were arranged yes-no–yes-no–yes-no–yes-no? Entropy could hardly be described as high. One could count just the even molecules, but what if the arrangement were yes-no–no-yes–yes-no–no-yes? **Order intrudes in ways that defy any straightforward counting algorithm**. And in information theory, **issues of meaning and representation present extra complications**. A sequence like 01 0100 0100 0010 111 010 11 00 000 0010 111 010 11 0100 0 000 000…might seem orderly only to an observer familiar with Morse code and Shakespeare. And what about the topologically perverse patterns of a strange attractor?”(263)\n- Observer-dependence\n\n“The mixing never reverses itself, even if you wait till the end of the universe, which is why the Second Law is so often said to be the part of physics that makes time a one-way street.”(264)\n\n“One could imagine water flowing past an obstruction. As every hydrodynamicist and white-water canoeist knows, if the water flows fast enough, it produces whorls downstream. At some speed, the whorls stay in place. At some higher speed, they move. An experimenter could choose a variety of methods for extracting data from such a system, with velocity probes and so forth, but why not try something simple: pick a point directly downstream from the obstruction and, at uniform time intervals, ask whether the whorl is to the right or the left.\nIf the whorls are static, the data stream will look like this: left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–left-left–. After a while, the observer starts to feel that new bits of data are failing to offer new information about the system.\nOr the whorls might be moving back and forth periodically: left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–left-right–. Again, though at first the system seems one degree more interesting, it quickly ceases to offer any surprises.”(267)\n\nChaotic attractors can be said to be \"eternally creative\" (p 263)\n\n“three differential equations, the minimum necessary for chaos, as Poincaré and Lorenz had shown.”(272)\n- [[Course Contents - Complex Systems#Third order change]]\n\n“As Farmer said, “When you think about a variable, the evolution of it must be influenced by whatever other variables it’s interacting with. Their values must somehow be contained in the history of that thing. Somehow their mark must be there.” In the case of Shaw’s dripping faucet the pictures illustrated the point. In three dimensions, especially, the patterns emerged, resembling loopy trails of smoke left by an out-of–control sky-writing plane.” (274)\n- [[Course Contents - Complex Systems#Takens Theorem]]\n\n“Truly random data remains spread out in an undefined mess. But chaos—deterministic and patterned—pulls the data into visible shapes. Of all the possible pathways of disorder, nature favors just a few.” (p. 267)\n- [[Course Contents - Complex Systems#Third order change]]\n\n“The Second Law is one piece of technical bad news from science that has established itself firmly in the nonscientific culture. **Everything tends toward disorder. Any process that converts energy from one form to another must lose some as heat. Perfect efficiency is impossible. The universe is a one-way street.** Entropy must always increase in the universe and in any hypothetical isolated system within it. However expressed, the Second Law is a rule from which there seems no appeal. In thermodynamics that is true. But the Second Law has had a life of its own in intellectual realms far removed from science, taking the blame for disintegration of societies, economic decay, the breakdown of manners, and many other variations on the decadent theme. These secondary, metaphorical incarnations of the Second Law now seem especially misguided. In our world, complexity flourishes, and those looking to science for a general understanding of nature’s habits will be better served by the laws of chaos.” (312)\n## Models\n“THE CHOICE IS ALWAYS the same. You can make your model more complex and more faithful to reality, or you can make it simpler and easier to handle. Only the most naïve scientist believes that the perfect model is the one that perfectly represents reality. Such a model would have the same drawbacks as a map as large and detailed as the city it represents, a map depicting every park, every street, every building, every tree, every pothole, every inhabitant, and every map. Were such a map possible, its specificity would defeat its purpose: to generalize and abstract. Mapmakers highlight such features as their clients choose. Whatever their purpose, maps and models must simplify as much as they mimic the world.” (285)\n- Reminds me of the beautiful short by Borges called \"On Exactitude in Science\" (\"Del rigor en la ciencia\") (see [[Week_49]] for the first time I heard about this)\n\n“Simulations break reality into chunks, as many as possible, but always too few” (211)\n\n## Linearity\n“Simply put, a linear process, given a slight nudge, tends to remain slightly off track. A nonlinear process, given the same nudge, tends to return to its starting point.”(299)\n\n“As he saw it, the problem was conceptual. Traditional methods for treating this “most unstable, dynamic, infinite-dimensional machine” were linear and reductionist. “The underlying paradigm remains: one gene → one peptide → one enzyme → one neurotransmitter → one receptor → one animal behavior → one clinical syndrome → one drug → one clinical rating scale. It dominates almost all research and treatment in psychopharmacology. More than 50 transmitters, thousands of cell types, complex electromagnetic phenomenology, and continuous instability based autonomous activity at all levels, from proteins to the electroencephalogram—and still the brain is thought of as a chemical point-to–point switchboard.” To someone exposed to the world of nonlinear dynamics the response could only be: How naïve. Mandell urged his colleagues to understand the flowing geometries that sustain complex systems like the mind.” (304)\n\n“Life sucks order from a sea of disorder. Erwin Schrödinger, the quantum pioneer and one of several physicists who made a nonspecialist’s foray into biological speculation, put it this way forty years ago: A living organism has the “astonishing gift of concentrating a ‘stream of order’ on itself and thus escaping the decay into atomic chaos.” (305)\n\n“But he might as well have told a gathering of paleontologists that dinosaurs had feathers. They knew better.” (308)\n\n## Conclusion\n“how a purposeless flow of energy can wash life and consciousness into the world.” Compounding the trouble is the slippery notion of entropy, reasonably well-defined for thermodynamic purposes in terms of heat and temperature, but devilishly hard to pin down as a measure of disorder.\" (312)\n\n“Nature forms patterns. Some are orderly in space but disorderly in time, others orderly in time but disorderly in space. Some patterns are fractal, exhibiting structures self-similar in scale. Others give rise to steady states or oscillating ones.” (312)",

(page 111)  \n\n> When I moved out of my mother’s house, shaky and determined, I began to fashion some different relationship to this country of our sojourn. I began to seek some more fruitful return than simple bitterness from this place of my mother’s exile, whose streets I came to learn better than my mother had ever learned them. But thanks to what she did know and could teach me, I survived in them better than I could have imagined. I made an adolescent’s wild and powerful commitment to battling in my own full eye, closer to my own strength, which was after all not so very different from my mother’s. And there I found other women who sustained me and from whom I learned other loving. How to cook the foods I had never tasted in my mother’s house. How to drive a stick-shift car. How to loosen up and not be lost.

    "content": "xvii - MYTH #3 The physical world is all there is.\n\nMaterialistically bound, traditional science assumes that anything that cannot be measured, tested in a laboratory, or probed by the five senses or their technological extensions simply doesn't exist. It's \"not real.\" The consequence: all of reality has been collapsed into physical reality. Spiritual, or what I would call nomphysical, dimensions of reality have been run out of town.\n\nThis clashes with the \"perennial philosophy,\" that philosophical consensus spanning ages, religions, traditions, and cultures, which describes different but continuous dimensions of reality. These run from the most dense and least conscious - what we'd call \"matter\" to the least dense and most conscious, which we'd call spiritual.\n\nXvii E - 1982 Aspect Experiment\n\n1 - 'I cannot live with myself any longer.\" This was the thought that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was. \"Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the 'I and the 'self that 'I' cannot live with.\" \"Maybe,\" I thought, \"only one of them is real.\"\n- Connect this to Lacan’s structure of  language, is this the imaginary self?\n\n3 - A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy.\n- Lol wtf!!!\n\n6 - Don't get attached to any words. They are only stepping stones, to be left behind as quickly as possible.\n- Mysticism, MOQ\n\n6 - This book can be seen as a restatement for our time of that one timeless spiritual teaching, the essence of all religions. It is not derived from external sources, but from the one true Source within, so it contains no theory or speculation.\n\n10 - You used the word Being. Can you explain what you mean by that?\n\nBeing is the eternal, ever-present One Life beyond the myriad forms of life that are subject to birth and death. However, Being is not only beyond but also deep within every form as its innermost invisible and indestructible essence. This means that it is accessible to you now as your own deepest self, your true nature. But don't seek to grasp it with your mind. Don't try to understand it. You can know it only when the mind is still. When you are present, when your attention is fully and intensely in the Now, Being can be felt, but it can never be understood mentally. To regain awareness of Being and to abide in that state of \"feeling-realization\" is enlightenment.\n\n17 - One day you may catch yourself smiling at the voice in your head, as you would smile at the antics of a child. This means that you no longer take the content of your mind all that seriously, as your sense of self does not depend on it. \n\n18 - personal and cultural conditioning. We may call this phantom self the ego. It consists of mind activity and can only be kept going through constant thinking. The term ego means different things to different people, but when I use it here it means a false self, created by uncon- scious identification with the mind. \n\n18 - Even when the ego seems to be concerned with the present, it is not the present that it sees: It misperceives it completely because it looks at it through the eyes of the past. Or it reduces the present to a means to an end, an end that always lies in the mind-projected future. Observe your mind and vou'll see that this is how it works. The present moment holds the key to liberation. But you cannot find the present moment as long as you are your mind. \n\n19 - Thought cannot exist without consciousness, but consciousness does not need thought. \n- Consciousness is prior to language? Sounds somewhat like Quality\n\n20 - B - insight. Even the great scientists have reported that their creative breakthroughs came at a time of mental quietude. The surprising \" result of a nation-wide inquiry among America's most eminent mathematicians, including Einstein, to find out their working meth- ods, was that thinking \"plays only a subordinate part in the brief. decisive phase of the creative act itself.\"1 So I would say that the sim- ple reason why the majority of scientists are not creative is not because they don't know how to think but because they don't know how to stop thinking! \n\n21 - aspect of the emotion Of course, you are not usually conscious of all your thought patterns, and it is often only through watching your emotions that you can bring them into awareness. \n\n22 - become aware! To watch an emotion in this way is basically the same as listening to or watching a thought, which I described earlier. The only difference is that, while a thought is in your head, an emotion has a strong physical component and so is primarilv felt in the body \n- Add to this that image of where in the body emotions are felt. \n\n22 - . if there is an apparent conflict between them, the thought will be the lie, the emotion will be the truth.\n\n23 - with the enou emotion temporary becomes our en an cods arde pullas up between your thinking and the emotion: they feed each other. The thought pattern creates a magnified reflection of itself in the form of an emotion, and the vibrational frequency of the emotion keeps feed- ing the original thought pattern. By dwelling mentally on the situa- tion, event, or person that is the perceived cause of the emotion, the thought feeds energy to the emotion, which in turn energizes the thought pattern, and so on. \n\n25 - Buddha means awakened one. \n\n27 - The pain that you create now is always some form of nonaccep- tance, some form of unconscious resistance to what is. On the level of thought, the resistance is some form of judgment. On the emo- tional level, it is some form of negativity. The intensity of the pain depends on the degree of resistance to the present moment, and this in turn depends on how strongly you are identified with your mind. \n\n27 - Why does the mind habitually deny or resist the Now? Because It cannot function and remain in control without time, which is past and future, so it perceives the timeless Now as threatening. Time and mind are in fact inseparable. \n\n28 - have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life. Whereas before you dwelt in time and paid brief visits to the Now, have your dwelling place in the Now and pay brief visits to past and future when required to deal with the practical aspects of your life situation. Always say \n\n29 - already there, and becomes lodged in your mind and body This, of course, includes the pain you suffered as a child, caused by the unconsciousness of the world into which you were born. \n- Relate to Lacan\n\n30 - self than in someone else. Watch out for any sign of unhappiness in yourself, in whatever form - it may be the awakening pain-body. This can take the form of irritation, impatience, a somber mood, a desire to hurt, anger, rage, depression, a need to have some drama in your relationship, and so on. Catch it the moment it awakens from its dormant state. \n\n31 - nobody is consciously insane\n\n31 - Some spiritual teachings state that all pain is ultimately an illu- sion, and this is true. The question is: Is it true for you? A mere belief doesn't make it true. Do you want to experience pain for the rest of your life and keep saying that it is an illusion? Does that free you from the pain? What we are concerned with here is how you can real- ize this truth - that is, make it real in your own experience. \n\n33 - vulnerable to the pain-body's attack \"Unconscious,\" the way that I use the word here, means to be identified with some mental or emo- tional pattern. It implies a complete absence of the watcher. \n\n37 - Once you have disidentitied from your mind, whee you aid right or wrong makes no difference to your sense of self at all, so the forcefully compulsive and deeply unconscious need to be right, which is a form of violence, will no longer be there. You can state clearly and firmly how you feel or what you think, but there will be no aggres- siveness or defensiveness about it. Your sense of self is then derived from a deeper and truer place within yourself, not from the mind. Watch out for any kind of defensiveness within yourself. What are you defending? An illusory identity, an image in your mind, a ficti- tious entity. By making this pattern conscious, by witnessing it, you disidentify from it. In the light of your consciousness, the uncon- scious pattern will then quickly dissolve. This is the end of all argu- \n\n36 - the number of people who have gone beyond mind is as yet extremely small, so you can assume that virtually everyone you meet or know lives in a state of fear. Only the intensity of it varies. It fluctuates between anxiety and dread at one end of the scale and a vague unease and distant sense of threat at the other. Most people become conscious of it only when it takes on one of its more acute forms! \n- Everyone always lives in fear \n\n37 - As long as the egoic mind is running your life, you cannot truly be at ease; you cannot be at peace or fulfilled except for brief intervals when you obtained what you wanted, when a craving has just been fulfilled Since the ego is a derived sense of self. it needs to identify \n- hedonic treadmill\n\n39 - B - study of madness isn't enough to create sanity. You have already understood the basic mechanics of the unconscious state: identifica- tion with the mind, which creates a false self, the ego, as a substitute for your true self rooted in Being. You become as a \"branch cut off from the vine,\" as Jesus puts it. \n\n40 - So once you recognize the root of unconsciousness as identifica- tion with the mind, which of course includes the emotions, you step out of it. You become present. When you are present, you can allow the mind to be as it is without getting entangled in it. The mind in itself is not dysfunctional. It is a wonderful tool. Dysfunction sets in when you seek your self in it and mistake it for who you are. It then becomes the egoic mind and takes over your whole life. \n\n41 - the Now is the only point that can take you beyond the limited confines of the mind. It is your only point of access into the timeless and formless realm of Being. \n\n41 - Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now. What you think of as the past is a memory trace, stored in the mind, of a former Now. When you remember the past, you reactivate a memory trace - and you do so now. The future is an imagined Now, a projection of the mind. When the future comes, it comes as the Now. When you think about the future, you do it now. Past and future obviously have no reality of their own. Just as the moon has no \n\n42 - The reason why some people love to engage in dangerous alas ties, such as mountain climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is that it forces them into the Now - that intensely alive state that is free of time, free of problems, free of think- ing, free of the burden of the personality. Slipping away from the pre- sent moment even for a second may mean death. Unfortunately, they come to depend on a particular activity to be in that state. But you don't need to climb the north face of the Eiger. You can enter that state now. \n\n43 - The whole essence of Zen consists in walking along the razor's edge of Now - to be so utterly, so completely present that no problem, no suffering, nothing that is not who you are in your essence, can sur- vive in you. In the Now, in the absence of time, all your problems dis- solve. Suffering needs time; it cannot survive in the Now. The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students' atten- tion away from time, would often raise his finger and slowly ask: \"What, at this moment, is lacking?\" A powerful question that does not require an answer on the level of the mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the Now. A similar question in the Zen tra- dition is this: \"If not now, when?\" \n\n44 - The Now is also central to the teaching of Sufism, the maysucat branch of Islam. Sufis have a saying: \"The Sufi is the son of time present.\" And Rumi, the great poet and teacher of Sufism, declares: \"Past and future veil God from our sight; burn up both of them with fire.\" Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, summed it all up beautifully: \"Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than time.\" \n\n45 - The mind cannot know the tree. It can only know facts or information about the tree. My mind cannot know you, only labels, judgements, facts, and opinions about you. \n- mysticism and quality preceding reality. \n\n47 - the lucase (Clock time is not just making an appointment or planning a trip. It includes learning from the past so that we don't repeat the same mistakes over and over. Setting goals and working toward them. Predicting the future by means of patterns and laws, physical, math- ematical and so on, learned from the past and taking appropriate action on the basis of our predictions. But even here, within the sphere of practical living, where we cannot do without reference to past and future, the present moment remains the essential factor: Any lesson from the past becomes rele- vant and is applied now. Any planning as well as working toward achieving a particular goal is done now. The enlightened person's main focus of attention is always the Now, but they are still peripherally aware of time. In other words, they continue to use clock time but are free of psychological time. \n\n47 - If you then become excessively focused on the goal, perhaps because you are seeking happiness, fulfillment, or a more complete sense of self in it, the Now is no longer honored. It becomes reduced to a mere. stepping stone to the future, with no intrinsic value. Clock time then \n- me when finishing a task but im too tired to do it well. \n\n49 - How does this mind pattern operate in your life? Are you always trying to get somewhere other than where you are? Is most of your doing just a means to an end? Is fulfillment always just around the corner or confined to short-lived pleasures, such as sex, food, drink, drugs, or thrills and excitement? Are you always focused on becom- ing, achieving, and attaining, or alternatively chasing some new thrill or pleasure? Do you believe that if you acquire more things you will become more fulfilled, good enough, or psychologically complete? Are you waiting for a man or woman to give meaning to your life? In the normal, mind-identified or unenlightened state of con- sciousness, the power and infinite creative potential that lie con- cealed in the Now are completely obscured by psychological time. \n\n50 - The past perpetuates itself through lack of presence. The quality of your consciousness at this moment is what shapes the future - which, of course, can only be experienced as the Now. \n\n52 - Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. just ours, don't interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures. Be aware of the silent presence of each thing. Be aware of the space that allows every- thing to be. Listen to the sounds; don't judge them. Listen to the silence underneath the sounds. Touch something - anything - and feel and acknowledge its Being. Observe the rhythm of your breath- ing; feel the air flowing in and out, feel the life energy inside your body. Allow everything to be, within and without. Allow the \"isness\" of all things. Move deeply into the Now. \n\n52 - Use your senses fully. Be where you are. Look around. Just look, don't interpret. See the light, shapes, colors, textures.

Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there isn't, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle. . If there is no joy, ease, or lightness in what you are doing, it does not necessarily mean that you need to change what you are doing. It may be sufficient to change the how. \"How\" is always more important than \"what.\" See if you can give much more atten- tion to the doing than to the result that you want to achieve through it. Give your fullest attention to whatever the moment presents. This implies that you also completely accept what is, because you cannot give your full attention to something and at the same time resist it. As soon as you honor the present moment, all unhappiness and struggle dissolve, and life begins to flow with joy and ease. When you act out of present moment awareness, whatever you do becomes imbued with a sense of quality, care, and love - even the most sim- ple action. \n\n61 - Thal Dea Being. It is a slalt dot on acuit paid of undappiness but of an almost continuous low level of unease, discontent, boredom, or nervousness - a kind of background static. You may not realize this because it is so much a part of \"normal\" living, just as you are not aware of a con- tinuous low background noise, such as the hum of an air conditioner, until it stops. When it suddenly does stop, there is a sense of relief. Many people use alcohol, drugs, sex, food, work, television, or even shopping as anesthetics in an unconscious attempt to remove the basic unease. When this happens, an activity that might be very enjoyable if used in moderation becomes imbued with a compulsive or addictive quality, and all that is ever achieved through it is extremely short-lived symptom relief. \n- on Ordinary consciousness\n\n63 - And the Buddha taught that the root of suffering is to be found in our constant wanting and craving. \n\n66 - ter. That's not a judgment, just a fact. It you had a choice, or realized that you do have a choice, would you choose suffering or joy, ease or unease, peace or conflict? Would you choose a thought or feeling that cuts you off from your natural state of well-being, within? Any such feelino the joy of life call \n- This is a good way to make people realize they don’t have free will. \n\n67 - Pass are avail- Coming back specitically to what you said - it is certainly true that, when you accept your resentment, moodiness, anger, and so on, you are no longer forced to act them out blindly, and you are less likely to project them onto others. But I wonder if you are not deceiv- ing yourself. When you have been practicing acceptance for a while, as you have, there comes a point when you need to go on to the next stage, where those negative emotions are not created anymore. If you don't, your \"acceptance\" just becomes a mental label that allows your ego to continue to indulge in unhappiness and so strengthen its sense of separation from other people, your surroundings, your here and now. As you know, separation is the basis for the ego's sense of identity. True acceptance would transmute those feelings at once. And if you really knew deeply that everything is \"okay,\" as you put it, and which of course is true, then would you have those negative feel- ings in the first place? Without judgment, without resistance to what is, they would not arise. You have an idea in your mind that \"every- thing is okay.\" but deep down you don't really believe it and so theold mental-emotional patterns of resistance are still in place. That's what makes you feel bad. \n- Next the asker says “that’s okay too”, and Tolle responds by asking whether they are defending their right to remain unconscious\n- Now, there is some truth in that, bc to many people, striving to live only in the Now and failing most of the time may lead to a build up of resentment. \n\n69 - Or is there something that you \"should\" be doing but are not doing it? Get up and do it now. Alternatively, completely accept your inactivity, laziness, or passivity at this moment, if that is your choice. Go into it fully. Enjoy it. Be as lazy or inactive as you can. If you go into it fully and consciously, you will soon come out of it. Or maybe you won't. Either way, there is no inner conflict, no resistance, no negativity. \n- On laziness. \n\n69 - Are you stressed? Are you so busy getting to the future that the present is reduced to a means of getting there? Stress is caused by being \"here\" but wanting to be \"there,\" or being in the present but wanting to be in the future. It's a split that tears you apart inside. To create and live with such an inner split is insane. The fact that every- one else is doing it doesn't make it any less insane. If you have to, you can move fast, work fast, or even run, without projecting yourself into the future and without resisting the present. As you move, work, run do it totally. Enjoy the flow of energy, the high energy of that moment. Now you are no longer stressed, no longer splitting yourself in two. Just moving, running, working - and enjoying it. Or you can drop the whole thing and sit on a park bench. But when you do, watch your mind. It may say: \"You should be working. You are wasting time. \" Observe the mind. Smile at it. \n\n71 - resource will De lace. Lone day a make 1. 13 you Ba as up so mana or jour attention that you reduce the present moment to a means to an end? Is it taking the joy out of your doing? Are you waiting to start living? If you develop such a mind pattern, no matter what you achieve or get, the present will never be good enough; the future will always seem better. A perfect recipe for permanent dissatisfaction and non- fulflment. don't you agree?\n\n72 - SO give up waiting as a state of mind. When you catch yourself slip ping into waiting.. snap out of it. Come into the present moment. Just be, and enjoy being. If you are present, there is never any need for you to wait for anything. So next time somebody says, \"Sorry to have kept you waiting,\" you can reply, \"That's all right, I wasn't waiting. I was just standing here enjoying myself - in joy in my self.\" \n\n74 - and lose your soul,\" as Jesus puts it Ultimately, of course, every outer purpose is doomed to \"fail? sooner or later, simply because it is sub- ject to the law of impermanence of all things. The sooner you realize that your outer purpose cannot give you lasting fulfillment, the better. When you have seen the limitations of your outer purpose, you give up your unrealistic expectation that it should make you happy, and you make it subservient to your inner purpose. \n\n75 - What is left when illusion ends? There is no need to investigate the unconscious past in you except as it manifests at this moment as a thought, an emotion, a desire, a reaction, or an external event that happens to you. Whatever you need to know about the unconscious past in you, the challenges of the present will bring it out. If you delve into the past, it will become a bottomless pit: There is always more. You may think that you need more time to understand the past or become free of it, in other words, that the future will eventually free you of the past. This is a delusion. Only the present can free you of the past. More time cannot free you of time. Access the power of Now. That is the key. \n- But what if that past makes it impossible to do so?\n\n80 - inner, holy essence. Whenever and wherever there is beauty, this inner essence shines through somehow. It only reveals itself to you when you are present. Could it be that this nameless essence and your presence are one and the same? Would it be there without your presence? Go deenlv into it. Find out for vourself. \n- Quality is in between the subject and the object\n\n80 - Doctor present, was that beauty or that sacredness there. Because of the narrowness of that gap and a lack of vigilance and alertness on your part, you were probably unable to see the fundamental difference between the perception, the thought-less awareness of beauty, and the naming and thought: \"The time gap was so small that it seamerel naming and interpreting of it as \n\n81 - since Being, consciousness and life are synonymous, we could say that presence means consciousness becoming conscious of itself, or life attaining self-consciousness. \n\n84 - suppress excessive mind activity If it weren't for alcohol, tranquiliz- ers, antidepressants, as well as the illegal drugs, which are all con- sumed in vast quantities, the insanity of the human mind would become even more glaringly obvious than it is already. I believe that, if deprived of their drugs, a large part of the population would become a danger to themselves and others. These drugs, of course, simply keep vou stuck in dysfunction. Their widespread use only delavs the breakdown of the old mind structures and the emergence ot higher consciousness. wake uncividual users may get some relet from the daily torture inflicted on them by their minds, they are pre- vented from generating enough conscious presence to rise above thought and so find true liberation. \n\n85 - consciousness, and you are done saying: \"The teacher and the taught together create the teaching.? In any case, the words in themselves are not important. They are not the Truth; they only point to it. \n- this is oddly similar to pointers, were they inspired by linguistics or is this just a very common pattern? Also in Lacan’s linguistics. \n\n87 - form, If only your master is an incarnation of God, then who are your Any kind of exclusivity is identification with form, and identification with form means ego, no matter how well disguised. \n\n89 - in Being, subject and object merge into one. \n- Reminds me of Pirsig saying that all monists ultimately believe in the same thing: Quality, arete, Being. \n\n90 - points, then don't use it Don't get stuck on the level of words. A word is no more than a means to an end. It's an abstraction. Not unlike a signpost, it points beyond itself. The word honey isn't honey. You can study and talk about honey for as long as you like, but you won't real- ly know it until you taste it. After you have tasted it, the word becomes less important to you. You won't be attached to it anvmore. \n\n94 - course birth and death - we share with the animals A long time after their fall from a state of grace and oneness into illusion, humans suddenly woke up in what seemed to be an animal body - and they found this very disturbing. \"Don't fool yourself. You are no more than an animal.\" This seemed to be the truth that was staring them in the face. But it was too disturbing a truth to tolerate. Adam and Eve saw that they were naked, and they became afraid. Unconscious denial of their animal nature set in very quickly. \n- Fascinating, animals don’t question their constituents like that\n\n95 - Of the ancient teachings concerning the body, only certain frag- ments survive, such as Jesus's statement that \"your whole body will be filled with light,\" or they survive as myths, such as the belief that Jesus never relinquished his body but remained one with it and ascended into \"heaven\" with it. Almost no one to this day has under- stood those fragments or the hidden meaning of certain myths, and the \"you are not your body\" belief has prevailed universally, leading to body denial and attempts to escape from the body. Countless seek- ers have thus been prevented from attaining spiritual realization for themselves and becoming finders. \n- The I’m the only One who REALly inderstands religious texts  shtick is pretty amroying. \n\n98 - Whenever you are waiting, wherever it may be, use that time to feel the inner body. In this way, traffic jams and line-ups become very enjoyable. Instead of mentally projecting yourself away from the Now, go more deeply into the Now by going more deeply into the body. \n\n99 - Attention does not mean that you start thinking about it. It means to just observe the emotion, to feel it fully, and so to acknowledge and accept it as it is. Some emotions are easily identified: anger, fear, grief, and so on. Others may be much harder to label. They may just be vague feelings of unease, heaviness, or constriction, halfway between an emotion and a physical sensation; In any case, what matters is not whether you can attach a mental label to it but whether you can bring the feeling of it into awareness as much as possible **Attention is the, key to transformation - and full attention also implies acceptance.** \n- Because if you don’t accept it, what are you even paying attention to?\n\n101 - comment\n- Being = presence + inner body awareness. The 2 access points into pure sensory input, one external one internal. \n\n102 - cells of the body The accumulation of time as the psychological our den of past and future greatly impairs the cells' capacity for self- renewal. So if you inhabit the inner body, the outer body will grow old at a much slower rate, and even when it does, your timeless essence will shine through the outer form, and you will not give the appear- ance of an old person. \n- BS\n\n103 - melas or outers, which are highly contagious **Inhabiting the body pro- tects you not by putting up a shield, but by raising the frequency vibra- ton of your total energy field, so that anything that vibrates at a lower frequency, such as fear, anger, depression, and so on, now exists in what is virtually a different order of reality. It doesn't enter your field of consciousness anymore, or if it does you don't need to offer any resistance to it because it passes right through you. Please don't just accept or reject what I am saying. Put it to the test**. There is a simple but powerful self-healing meditation that you can do whenever you feel the need to boost your immune system. It is particularly effective if used when you feel the first symptoms of an illness, but it also works with illnesses that are already entrenched if you use it at frequent intervals and with an intense focus. It will also counteract any disruption of your energy field by some form of neg. ativity. However, it is not a substitute for the moment-to-moment practice of being in the body; otherwise, its effect will only be tempo- rary. Here it is. **When you are unoccupied for a few minutes, and especially last thing at night before falling asleep and first thing in the morning before getting up, \"food\" your body with consciousness. Close your eyes. Lie flat on your back. Choose different parts of your body to focus your attention on briefly at first: hands, feet, arms, legs, abdomen, chest, head, and so on. Feel the life energy inside those parts as intensely as you can. Stay with each part for fifteen seconds or so. Then let your attention run through the body like a wave a few times, from feet to head and back again. This need only take a minute or so. After that, feel the inner body in its totality, as a single field of energy. Hold that feeling for a few minutes. Be intensely present dur- ing that time, present in every cell of your body. Don't be concerned if the mind occasionally succeeds in drawing your attention out of the body and you lose yourself in some thought. As soon as you notice that this has happened, just return vour attention to the inner bodv. **\n\n104 - If at any time you are finding it hard to get in out Body, it is usually easier to focus on your breathing first. Conscious breathing, which is a powerful meditation in its own right, will grad- ually put you in touch with the body. Follow the breath with your attention as it moves in and out of your body. Breathe into the body, and feel your abdomen expanding and contracting slightly with each inhalation and exhalation. If you find it easy to visualize, close your eyes and see yourself surrounded by light or immersed in a luminous substance - a sea of consciousness. Then breathe in that light. Feel that luminous substance filling up your body and making it lumi- nous also. Then gradually focus more on the feeling. You are now in your body. Don't get attached to any visual image. \n\n105 - way to enter that state is through your body Whenever an answer, a solution, or a creative idea is needed, stop thinking for a moment by focusing attention on your inner energy field. Become aware of the stillness. When you resume thinking, it will be fresh and creative. In any thought activity, make it a habit to go back and forth every few minutes or so between thinking and an inner kind of listening, an inner stillness. We could say: don't just think with your head, think with your whole body \n- on harboring creativity. \n\n109 - as you go about your life, don’t give 100 percent of your attention to the external world and to your mind. Keep some within. \n\n112 - It's up to you to open a portal in your life that gives you conscious access to the Unmanifested. Get in touch with the energy field of the inner body, be intensely present, disidentify from the mind, surren- der to what is; these are all portals you can use - but you only need to use one. \n\n115 - B Here is why The inner equivalent to cujects niture, walls, and so on are your mind objects: thoughts, emotions, and the objects of the senses. And the inner equivalent of space is the consciousness that enables your mind objects to be, just as space allows all things to be. So if you withdraw attention from things - objects in space - you automatically withdraw attention from your mind objects as well. In other words: You cannot think and be aware of space - or of silence, for that matter. By becom- ing aware of the empty space around you, you simultaneously become aware of the space of no-mind, of pure consciousness: the Unmanifested. This is how the contemplation of space can become a portal for you. *Space and silence are two aspects of the same thing, the same no- thing. They are an externalization of inner space and inner silence, which is stillness*: the infinitely creative womb of all existence. \n\n127 - he or she may counter your attack.

Not in psychiatry residency training programs. Psychiatry is on the verge of abandoning the field of psychotherapy. Young psychiatrists are forced to specialize in psychopharmacology because third-party payers now reimburse for psychotherapy only if it is delivered by low-fee (in other words,\n\n15\n\nRather than attempt to develop existential psychotherapy curricula, I prefer to supplement the education of all well-trained dynamic therapists by increasing their sensibility to existential issues.\n\n16\n\nIn fact, the effective therapist should never try to force discussion of any content area: T herapy should not be theory-driven but relationship-driven.\n\n23\n\nThe most useful concept in that book was the notion that the human being has an inbuilt propensity toward self-realization. If obstacles are removed, Horney believed, the individual will develop into a mature, fully realized adult, just as an acorn will develop into an oak tree. “Just as an acorn develops into an oak . . .”\n\n27\n\nOnce we make a diagnosis, we tend to selectively inattend to aspects of the patient that do not fit into that particular diagnosis, and correspondingly overattend to subtle features that appear to confirm an initial diganosis. \n\n27\n\nWhat's more, a diagnosis may act as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Relating to a patient as a “borderline” or a  “hysteric” may serve to stimulate and perpetuate those very traits. Indeed, there is a long history of iatrogenic influence on the shape of clinical entities, including the current controversy about multiple-personality disorder and repressed memories of sexual abuse. And keep in mind, too, the low reliability of the DSM personality disorder category (the very patients often engaging in longer-term psychotherapy)\n\n31\n\nPreternatural\n\n(a.) Beyond of different from what is natural, or according to the regular course of things, but not clearly supernatural or miraculous; strange; inexplicable; extraordinary; uncommon; irregular; abnormal; as, a preternatural appearance; a preternatural stillness; a preternatural presentation (in childbirth) or labor.\n\n36\n\nKeep in mind the therapist’s great power— power that, in part, stems from our having been privy to our patients’ most intimate life events, thoughts, and fantasies.  \n\n37\n\nEquanimity\n\n(n.) Evenness of mind; that calm temper or firmness of mind which is not easily elated or depressed; patience; calmness; composure; as, to bear misfortunes with equanimity.\n\n40\n\nFifty years ago Carl Rogers identified “accurate empathy” as one of the three essential characteristics of the effective therapist (along with “unconditional positive regard” and “genuineness”) and launched the field of psychotherapy research, which ultimately marshaled considerable evidence to support the effectiveness of empathy.\n\n54\n\nIf you make a mistake, admit it. Any attempt at cover-up will  \nultimately backfire. At some level the patient will sense you are  \nacting in bad faith, and therapy will suffer. Furthermore, an  \nopen admission of error is good model-setting for patients.\n\n56\n\nIn his autobiography, Jung describes his appreciation of the  uniqueness of each patient’s inner world and language, a uniqueness that requires the therapist to invent a new therapy language for each patient. Perhaps I am overstating the case,  \nbut I believe the present crisis in psychotherapy is so serious and therapist spontaneity so endangered that a radical corrective is demanded. We need to go even further: the therapist must strive to create a new therapy for each patient. Therapists must convey to the patient that their paramount task is to build a relationship together that will itself become the therapy. \n\n62\n\nWe must demonstrate our willingness to enter into a deep intimacy with our patient\n\n70\n\nThe second postulate—that therapy is a social microcosm— means that eventually (provided we do not structure it too heavily) the interpersonal problems of the patient will manifest themselves in the here-and-now of the therapy relationship. \n\n87\n\nThis is precisely why I so emphasize personal therapy for therapists. If you develop a deep knowledge of yourself, eliminate the majority of your blind spots, and have a good base of patient experience, you will begin to know how much of the boredom or confusion is yours and how much is evoked by the patient. \n\n> why personal psychotherapy is important\n\n99\n\nIn group therapy it is exceedingly evident that one of the tasks of the group therapist is to demonstrate behavior that the group members can emulate. \n\n107\n\nPatients are already burdened with the primary anxiety that brings them to therapy and it makes little sense to plunge them into a process that may create secondary anxiety—anxiety from exposure to an ambiguous social situation without guidelines for proper behavior or participation. Therefore it is wise to pre-pare patients systematically for the process of psychotherapy.\n\n## 107\n \nPreparation for individual psychotherapy is also essential. Though individuals are likely to have had experience with intense relationships, it is highly unlikely that they have been in a relationship requiring them to trust fully, to reveal all, to hold nothing back, to examine all nuances of their feelings to another, and to receive nonjudgmental acceptance. In initial interviews I cover important ground rules, including confiden- tiality, the necessity for full disclosure, the importance of dreams, the need for patience. Because the here-and-now focus may seem unusual to patients I present its rationale. If a new patient has described relationship difficulties (and that means just about every patient), I might say, for example:\n\n“It’s clear that one of the areas we need to address is your relationship with others. It is difficult for me to know the precise nature of your difficulties in relation- ships because I, of course, know the other persons in your life only through your own eyes. Sometimes your descriptions may be unintentionally biased, and I’ve found that I can be more helpful to you by focusing on the one relationship where I have the most accurate information—the relationship between you and me. It is for this reason I shall often ask you to examine what is happening between the two of us.”\n\nIn short I suggest total disclosure about the mechanism of therapy.\n\n115\n\nAnd why did I make  \nthe choice I did? I’m sure it’s because I’d rather associate  \nmyself with the more refined restaurant. I’d feel uncomfortable saying, ‘Turn at the taco stand.’” Again, what’s the risk? I’m only  \nacknowledging something he obviously knew. And only when  \nwe got my admission out of the way could we turn to the import issues at hand. \n\ndesire underlies much of what we do and say\n\n## 115\n\nDo both! Some therapists make a point of responding to quest  \nions with: “I’ll be glad to answer that, but first I’d like to know as much as possible about the asking of that question.” Sometimes I use that approach, but I’ve rarely found particular advantage in insisting on any particular order (“You go first and then I’ll respond”). If it is a new patient I often choose simply to model disclosure and to store the incident in my mind to return to later.  \n\n> when a patient asks you a question, it is always wise to explore their reasons for asking that question.\n\n115\n\n\"hoe was die gedachtenwisseling voor je?\"\n\n116\n\nKeep in mind that, though the patients have confidentiality,  \ntherapists do not. Nor can one request it of patients, who may in the future consult another therapist and must feel unencumbered in what they may discuss. If there is certain information that you strongly do not wish to become public, do not share it with patients. \n\npatients have confidetiality but therapists do not\n\n117\n\nGalvanize\n\n(v. t.)

See Galvanized iron.\n\n119\n\nAkey therapeutic factor in group therapy is universal-ity. Many patients begin therapy feeling unique in  \nt  \nheir wretchedness; they believe they alone have t  \nhoughts and fantasies that are awful, forbidden, tabooed, s  \nadistic, selfish, and sexually perverse. The self-disclosure of s  \nimilar thoughts by other group members is wonderfully comforting and provides a “welcome to the human race” ex-p\n\nties into the normalisation technique in shea's case method\n\n129\n\nt  \nheir patients.

The state of being bereaved; deprivation; esp., the loss of a relative by death.\n\n130\n\nHarry Stack Sullivan, an influential American psychiatric  \nt  \nheorist, is reputed to have once described psychotherapy as a d  \niscussion of personal issues between two people, one of them more\n\n131\n\nincriminating—then I make a point of focusing on the  \nprocess of the comment as well as its content. (Keep in mind  \nthat process refers to the nature of the relationship between the  \npeople in the interaction.\n\nCONTENT AND PROCESS\n\n133\n\nAnytime you feel like saying, “Dammit, all these  \nwasted hours, why didn’t  \nyou tell me this before,” that is just t  \nhe time to bite your tongue and shift the focus onto the fact that the patient did finally develop the trust to reveal this infor-mation\n\n135\n\nT  \nhe quadrants vary in size between individuals: Some cells a  \nre large in some individuals, shrunken in others. In therapy we attempt to change the size of the four cells. We  \ntry to help the p  \nublic cell grow larger at the expense of the other three and the secret self to shrink, as patients, through the process of self-d  \nisclosure, share more of themselves—at first to the therapist a  \nnd then judiciously to other appropriate figures in their lives. And, of course, we hope to diminish the size of the uncon-s  \ncious self by helping patients explore and become acquainted w  \nith deeper layers of themselves. But it is cell 2, the blind self,  \nthat we particularly target— both in individual and group therapy. A goal of therapy is to  \ni  \nncrease reality testing and to help individuals see themselves a  \ns others see them. It is through the agency of feedback that the blind self cell grows appreciably smaller.\n\nthis might be worth explaining whenever a patient does not accept a statement about themselves\n\n139\n\nand also I often feel  \nso closely scrutinized and evaluated that my spontaneity  \nis stifled.

A kind of natural ebullition; that commotion of a fluid which takes place when some part of the mass flies off in a gaseous form, producing innumerable small bubbles; as, the effervescence of a carbonate with citric acid.\n\n144\n\nAnyone  \nelse ever said this to you?\n\nimportant to ask after givin fb\n\n150\n\nToo often in bereavement work we focus exten-s  \nively and exclusively upon loss, upon unfinished business in t  \nhe relationship, upon the task of detaching ourselves from the d  \nead and entering again into the stream of life. Though all t  \nhese steps are important, we must not neglect the fact that the d  \neath of the other also serves to confront each of us, in a stark and poignant manner, with our own death.\n\nbereavement as a segue for the topic of death\n\n150\n\n-t  \nions. Death and mortality form the horizon for all discussions a  \nbout aging, bodily changes, life stages, and many significant l  \nife markers, such as major anniversaries, departure of children f  \nor college, the empty-nest phenomenon, retirement, the birth of grandchild\n\n151\n\nquestions as When did you first become aware of death? Wi  \nth w  \nhom did you discuss it? How did adults in your life respond to y  \nour questions? What deaths have you experienced? Funerals a  \nttended? Religious beliefs regarding death? How have your attitudes about death changed during your life? Strong fan-t  \nasi\n\nquestions about death\n\n151\n\nA  \nnswers to this question generally include fears of the dying p  \nrocess, concerns for survivors, concerns about the afterlife (which beg the question by transforming death into a nonter-m  \ninal event\n\ncommon answers to death questions\n\n152\n\na  \nnd sleeping on her stomach.

Sex is the great death-neutralizer, the absolute  \nv  \nital antithesis of death. Some patients who are exposed to the g  \nreat threat of death suddenly become pervasively preoccupied with sexual thoughts. (There are TAT [Thematic Appreciation  \nTests] studies documenting increased sexual content in cancer  \npatients.) The French term for orgasm, la petite mort (  \n“little d  \neath”), signifies the orgasmic loss of the self, which eliminates t  \nhe pain of separateness—the lonely “I” vanishing into the m\n\n155\n\ne  \nhumans appear to be meaning-seeking creatures w  \nho have had the misfortune of being thrown into a w  \norld devoid of intrinsic meaning. One of our major t  \nasks is to invent a meaning sturdy enough to support a life and to perform the tricky maneuver of denying our personal author-s  \nhip of this meaning. Thus we conclude instead that it was “out there” waiting for us. Our ongoing search for substantial mean-i\n\n157\n\nU  \nnlike my approach to other existential ultimate concerns (  \ndeath, isolation, freedom), I find that meaning in life is best approache\n\n158\n\no  \nbstacles to engagement.

Some arrive quickly at an understanding of t  \nheir role in their discomfiture; others find responsibility a  \nssumption so difficult that it constitutes the major part of therapy,  \nand once that step is taken, therapeutic change may occur almost automatically and effortlessly.\n\n163\n\nTo look back over one’s life and to accept the responsibility  \no  \nf what one has done to oneself may result in great regret. The t  \nherapist must anticipate that regret and attempt to reframe it. I  \noften urge patients to project themselves into the future and to consider how they can live now s  \no that five years hence they w  \nill be able to look back upon life without regret sweeping over them\n\n165\n\nT  \nhough I avoided the trap of telling him explicitly what to do, I managed to get my views across to him. We  \ntherapists h  \nave our little cunning ways—statements such as: “I wonder w  \nhat blocks you from acting upon the decision you already seem to have made.” (And I wonder, what on earth would ther-apists do without the device of “I wonder”?). And so in one way  \no  \nr another I did him the great service (in only three fast-paced s  \nessions!) of mobilizing him into writing the inevitable “Dear J  \nohn” letter to Darlene and sailing off into a glowing Caribbean sunset with Pa  \ntrici\n\n166\n\nthe moral of t  \nhis cautionary tale is, beware of leaping in to make decisions for the patient. It is always a bad idea. As this  \nv  \nignette illustrates, not only do we lack a crystal ball, but we w  \nork with unreliable data. The information supplied by the p  \natient is not only distorted but is likely to change as time p  \nasses or as the relationship with the therapist changes. Inevitably, new and unexpected factors emerge. If, as was true  \ni  \nn this instance, the information the patient presents very s  \ntrongly supports a specific course of action, then the patient, for any of a number of reasons, is seeking support for a particu-l  \nar d\n\n168\n\nsomething much better to do with decision dilemmas. Deci-sions are a via regia,  \na royal road, into a rich existential domain—the realm of freedom, responsibility, choice, regret,  \nwishing, and willing. To settle for superficial preemptive advice  \ni  \ns to forgo the opportunity of exploring this realm with your p\n\n169\n\nO  \nne of my first steps in therapy is to help patients assume r  \nesponsibility for their actions. I try to help them understand that they make a decision even by not deciding or by maneu-v  \nering another into making a decision for them. Once patients accept that premise and own their behavior, then, in one man-ner or another, I pose the key therapy question: “Are you satis-fi  \ned with that?” (Satisfied both with the nature of the decision a\n\n177\n\nSometimes I simply remind  \np  \natients that sooner or later they will have to relinquish the g\n\n181\n\nI am rarely the one who begins the session. Like most thera-p  \nists, I prefer instead to wait for the patient. I want to know his o  \nr her “point of urgency” (as Melanie Klein referred to it). However,  \nif I ever do open the session, it is invariably to refer b  \nack to the last meeting. Hence, if there was a particularly m  \nomentous or emotional or truncated session, I might begin, “We discussed many important things last week. I wonder what  \nk\n\n184\n\nh  \now they were or are perceived. I know one elderly man who met someone from his fifth-grade class who told him that she 1  \n63 Encourage Self-Monitoring r  \nemembered him as a “beautiful boy with coal-black hair and a s  \nly smile.” He wept as he heard that. He had always regarded h  \nimself as homely and awkward. Had someone, anyone, only told him then t  \nhat he was beautiful, it would have, he believed, c\n\n186\n\nBecause weeping often signifies the entry into deeper cham-bers of emotion, the therapist’s task is not to be polite and help  \nt  \nhe patient stop weeping. Quite the contrary—you may wish to encourage your patients to plunge even deeper. You may simply  \nurge them to share their thoughts: “Don’t try to leave that  \ns  \npace. Stay with it. Please keep talking to me; try to put your f  \neelings into words.” Or you may ask a question I often use: “If y  \nour\n\n186\n\nPsychotherapy may be thought of as an a  \nlternating sequence o\n\n196\n\nM  \nost published firsthand accounts of psychotherapy point to the same discrepancy: T  \nherapists place a far higher value than patient\n\n198\n\nA  \nt the most fundamental level the relationship between i  \nnsight and change remains an enigma. Though we take for g  \nranted that insight leads to change, by no means is that sequence established empirically.  \nIn fact there are experienced, t  \nhoughtful analysts who have raised the possibility of a reversed sequence—that is, that insight follows change rather than pre-c  \n\n201\n\nTh  \nerapy or personal-growth groups have, for decades, u  \nsed accelerating, or “unfreezing,” techniques. Some t  \nhat I have found useful include the “trust fall,” in which t  \nhe group forms a circle around a member who, eyes closed, f  \nalls backward to be caught by the group members. In the “top s  \necret” exercise, each of the members writes down, on uniform s  \nlips of paper without identifying details, a top secret that w  \nould feel risky for them to reveal. The statements are then redistributed and each member reads someone else’s top secret  \na  \nnd d\n\n202\n\ns  \nlowed down. Beginning therapists must learn that there are times to sit in silence, sometimes in silent communion, some-times simply while waiting for patients’ thoughts to appear in a  \nform that\n\n204\n\ncient.  \nPsychotherapy is n  \not a substitute for life but a dress rehearsal for life. In other w  \nords, though psychotherapy requires a close relationship, the r  \ne\n\n205\n\nOne often hears of patients (in either group therapy or indi-v  \nidual therapy) who are excellent patients or group members, y  \net remain essentially unchanged in their external lives. They may relate well to the individual therapist or may be key mem-bers of groups—self-disclosing, working hard, catalyzing inter-a  \nction—and yet do not apply what they have learned to their outside situation. In other words, they use therapy as a substi-t  \nute rather than a rehearsal for life. T  \nhis distinction may prove useful in termination decisions. B  \nehavior change in the therapy situation is obviously not enough: patients must transfer their change into their life envi-ronment. In the late stages of therapy, I am energetic in ensur-ing transfer of learning. If I deem it necessary, I begin to coach  \nactively,  \nto press the patient to experiment with new behaviors in work,\n\n207\n\npresenting problem.

Sometimes years, even d  \necades, pass before they can meet or even think of the other without twinges of desire or anxiety.\n\nthis one hits close to home sadly\n\n227\n\nN  \nor is the dissolution a steady process. Setbacks occur— a  \nnd nothing is more likely to bring about a setback than another encounter with the beloved. Pa  \ntients offer many r  \nationalizations for such new contact: they insist that they are o  \nver it now and that a cordial talk, a coffee, or lunch with the former beloved will help to clarify things, help them to under-s  \ntand what went wrong, help them establish a lasting adult f  \nriendship, or even permit them to say good-bye like a mature person. None of these things is likely to come to pass.  \nGenerally the individual’s  \nrecovery is set back, much as a slip sets back a r\n\ntht is dark but valuable\n\n227\n\na  \nrrive at the question: What would you be thinking about if you were not obsessed with .\n\nhonestly i think in large part i wanted to prove that i was worthy at first compared to ramin, who i was very jealous of. then it indeed distorted into sth else, especially once i learned she had me in much higher regard than she did him, yet she couldnt be with me. it was very painful\n\n228\n\nEa  \nrly in their training, psychotherapy students are taught s  \nome systematic history-taking schemes. These schemes always include such items as the patient’s presenting  \ncomplaint, present illness, and history (including family, edu-cation, physical health, previous therapy, friendships, etc.).\n\nuseful!\n\n230\n\nDe  \nspite my reliance on an intuitive mode of collecting d  \nata, there is one particularly productive inquiry I a  \nlways make in the first or second session: “Please give me a detailed account of your typical day.”  \nI make sure everything is discussed, including eating and  \nsleeping habits, dreaming, recreation, periods of discomfort  \nand of joy, precise tasks at work, the use of alcohol and drugs,  \neven reading, film, and TV preferences. If this inquiry is suffi-ciently detailed, therapists can learn a great deal, uncovering  \ninformation that is often missed in other history-taking systems.  \nI  \nlisten to many things: eating habits, aesthetic preferences, leisure-time activities. In particular,  \nI attend to how my patients’ lives are peopled. With whom do they have regular  \ncontact? What faces do they regularly see? With whom do they  \nh  \nave phone conversations or speak personally during the week? With whom do they have meals?\n\nthis is goldennnnnn\n\n233\n\nThe significant others are, of course, threatened by an invi-tation to meet their partner’s therapist. The partner appreciates 212 t  \nhe gift of therapy that the therapist who will be sizing them up has, understand-ably, a primary loyalty to the patient. But there is a strategy that  \nr  \narely fails to diminish the threat and generally is effective in p  \nersuading the partner to come to the session. Instruct your p  \natient in the following manner: “  \nJohn, please tell X that she could help me be more h  \nelpful to you. I’d like to obtain some of her feedback a  \nbout you—especially some of the ways she might like to s  \nee you change. This is not an examination of her but a d  \niscussion of her observations of you.” Moreover, I recommend that the session be conducted in  \njust that manner.  \nSince I prefer to have no secret, outside k  \nnowledge of my patients, I always interview the significant other in the presence of my patient.\n\nhetereanamnese doen in bijzijn van partner\n\n237\n\npatient listener,  \nis of one day when I had placed myself on trial f  \nor greedily anticipating the money I might inherit when my p  \narents died.

Nor that she normalized my base impulses.  \nNo, it was something else: It was the word we.

Not so with Freud. Though he did not win a Nobel  \nP  \nrize for scientific contribution, he was awarded the Goethe Prize for literary achievement. Throughout Freud’s texts, his  \np  \nrose sparkles, even through the veil of translation. Indeed many of the clinical tales resemble those of a master storyteller.\n\nfreu lezen!!! er ligt een boek van hem in reuver\n\n245\n\nWe  \nston and Morrison.) First, I urge clinicians to keep in mind that nonvalidated therapies are not invalidated t  \nherapies. Research, if it is to be funded, must have a clean design com-parable to research testing drug efficacy. Design demands  \ni  \nnclude “clean” patients (that is, patients with a single disorder w  \nithout symptoms of any other diagnostic groups—a type of p  \natient uncommonly seen in clinical practice), a brief therapy i  \nntervention, and a replicable, preferably manualized (that is, c  \napable of being reduced to a step-by-step written manual) t  \nreatment mode. Such a design heavily favors CBT and e  \nxcludes most traditional therapies that rely on an intimate (unscripted) therapist-patient relationship forged in genuine-n  \ness and focusing on the here-and-now as it spontaneously e  \nvolve\n\n256\n\nIncidentally,  \nit is not unusual for a follow-up dream the same n  \night to express the same issue but in different image language. (Freud referred to such dreams as companion dreams.)\n\n258\n\nU  \nsually my first question is about the dream affect. “What a  \nre the feelings you experience in the various parts of the d  \nream? What is the emotional center of the dream?” Next I u  \nrge patients to select parts of the dream and associate freely to t  \nhe content. Or I may select promising parts of the dream for t  \nhem to mull upon. “Just take a couple of minutes,” I instruct t  \nhem, “and think about [some part of the dream] and let your mind wander freely.  \nThink out loud. Say anything that comes into your mind. Don’t censor, don’t dismiss thoughts because  \nt  \nhey seem silly or irrelevant.” A  \nnd, of course, I inquire about the relevant events of the d  \nay preceding the dream (the “day residue”). I have always found quite useful Freud’s formulation that the dream borrows  \nb  \nuilding blocks from the day residue, but that for images to be i  \nmportant enough to become incorporated into it, they must be reinforced by older, meaningful, affect-laden concerns.\n\non navigating dreams\n\n267\n\nA  \nfemale patient once dreamed the night before her first s  \nession that I would break all the windows in her home and g  \nive her an anesthetic injection in the heart. Our discussion of t  \nhe anesthetic injection in the heart disclosed that, though she w  \nas a highly successful scientist, she was strongly tempted to overturn her career and try to become a painter.  \nShe was afraid t  \nhat my therapy would put her artist heart to sleep and force her to continue her more rational but deadened life trajectory.\n\n267\n\nAssume that new patients have fears and confusion about ther-a  \npy and make certain to prepare each patient for the course of psychotherapy.\n\n.\n\n268\n\nA  \npatient dreamed the following: “I am in your office and you say to me, ‘You’re an odd  \nbird. I’ve never seen anything like you before.’ ”  \nA  \ns usual, I inquired about the feeling tone of the dream. “Warm and cozy,” he responded.\n\n275\n\np  \nractice. Overspecialization, especially in clinical areas loaded w  \nith great pain and desolation—for example, working with the d  \nying, or the severely chronically impaired or psychotic—puts t  \nhe therapist much at risk; I believe that balance and diversity in one’s\n\n275\n\nO  \nf all the stresses in the life of the psychotherapist, there a  \nre two that are particularly catastrophic: the suicide of a p\n\n279\n\nWe are cradlers of secrets.

Environment: temperatuur\n\nDrie groepen middelen:\n- Dempende/verdovende middelen\n- Stimulantia\n- Psychedelica (waaronder cannabis)\n\nVraag je in deze volgorde af:\nIs de patient 'langzaam, snel, of raar?'\n\nToxicodromen:\n- Dempende middelen: verminderd bewustzijn (*suf*), lage pols, vertraagde ademhaling, pinpoint pupillen, slappe spiertonus, verminderde darmperistaltiek, bleek gelaat, verlaagde temperatuur. \n- Stimulantia: versnelde ademhaling, versnelde pols, hoge bloeddruk, hypertonie, toegenomen darmperistaltiek, blozend gelaat, hyperthermie. \n\nAandachtspunten:\n- Het stimulantia toxicodroom zie je ook bij onthouding van verdovende middelen als heroine. \n- Alcohol werkt in lage doseringen stimulerend/disinhiberend en in hoge doseringen dempend/sederend. Dit geldt net zo voor GHB. \n- Stimulerende middelen veroorzaken een risico voor de circulatie, dempende middelen voor de ademhaling.\n- 80% van de alcoholisten heeft een thiaminedeficientie. \n- Het laatste restje thiamine in het lichaam kan gebruikt worden als een patient een voedzame maaltijd krijgt, en dus moet een thiamineinjectie worden gegeven voordat een patient gaat eten. \n- Onthouding van opiaten is heftig en vervelend, maar niet gevaarlijk. \n- Benzodiazepine-onthouding kan net als alcoholonthouding voor epileptische insulten en onttrekkingsdelieren zorgen.\n- Benzodiazepineoverdosis is zelden fataal, maar wel i.c.m. andere middelen.\n- GHB-intoxicatie is minder gevaarlijk dan GHB-onthouding.\n- GHB-onthouding kan tot weken na staken plotseling verergeren. \n- GHB heeft een zeer korte halfwaardetijd van 30 min. \n\nGHB-onthouding:\n- Soms mild: tremor, rusteloos, slapeloos. Maar ook: hevige angst, motorische onrust, spiersamentrekkingen, autonome instabiliteit, psychose, hallucinaties, verwardheid en delirium. \n- Complicaties: pneumonie, rabdomyolyse. Kan levensbedreigend worden.\n- Kan weken aanhouden, waarbij symptomen kunnen toenemen of zelfs voor de eerste keer verschijnen *in de tweede week* na aanvankelijk verbetering. \n- Behandeling: hoge doseringen benzodiazepinen, bijv. 100-300 mg diazepam of tot 22 mg lorazepam per dag. \n\nCannabis:\n- THC werkt als partiele agonist op de cannabinoidenreceptor $CB_1$, wat de psychotrope effecten geeft.\n- Cannabidiol werkt als partiele antagonist op de $CB_1$-receptor, en als agonist op het serotoninesysteem. Het werkt **antipsychotisch** en **anxiolytisch**. \n- De verstoorde THC-CBD ratio maakt het risico op een psychotische stoornis groter. \n\nAcute gevaarlijke situaties:\n- Excited delirium syndrome (EDS) - acuteopwindingsdelier\n\t- Levensbedreigende situatie. \n\t- Delier + extreme agressie, vermoeden van intoxicatie, ongevoelig voor pijn, versnelde ademhaling, transpireren, buitengewoon sterk zijn, niet moe worden, kermende geluiden maken. \n\t- De agressie is ongericht, contact maken is onmogelijk. \n\t- Behandeling: 4 mg lorazepam IM. Liefst niet fixeren, indien onvermijdelijk: lorazepam **intraveneus** geven in ambulance. \n- Hyperthermie\n- Hypothermie\n- Hyponatriemie\n\nBij een acute opwindingstoestand geef je eigenlijk altijd **lorazepam 2,5 mg per os** of **lorazepam 2 mg IM**. Nog geen antipsychotica.\n\nVervolgzorg:\n- Zonder intrinsieke motivatie heeft ontgiften doorgaans geen zin.\n\t- Geen verband tussen verslaving en klachten.\n\t- Nooit eerder willen stoppen.\n- Veelvuldig onsuccesvol ontgiften leidt niet tot langdurige abstinentie en geeft een steeds groter risico op cognitieve schade en terugval in alcoholgebruik. \n\nOntslagwens na eerste opvang:\n- Acute intoxicatie hoeft niet binnen de WVGGZ opgenomen te worden. Fixeren of VBI toepassen o.b.v. de WGBO. \n\t- Als vervolgens toch een psychose o.i.d. bestaat is sprake van wilsonbekwaamheid ter zake. Dan kan wel volgens de WVGGZ gehandeld worden. \n\nMotiverende gespreksvoering:\n- Vanuit een empathische en respectvolle houding wordt de eigen verantwoordelijkheid van de patient centraal gesteld en worden zijn mogelijkheden bevestigd (self-efficacy).",

Consciousness expands to include all these responses simultaneously. In later stages, following a large dose of a hallucinogen, a person may experience a feeling of union with nature associated with a dissolution of personal identity, engendering a state of beatitude or even ecstasy. A dissociative reaction, in which the subject loses contact with immediate reality, may also occur. A subject may experience abandonment of the body, may see elaborate visions, or feel the imminence of death, which could lead to terror and panic. The experience is determined by the person’s mental state, the structure of his or her personality, the physical setting, and cultural influences.\n- [[General characteristics of the psychedelic experience]]\n- [[set and setting]]\n\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">46</mark>\nHis superego, as manifest in the strong social conscience and mastery of his basic impulses, is powerful and dominating.\n- [[Definition of the superego]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">55</mark>\ninsistence that science is only a method for determining what is true and not a body of beliefs in itself.\n- [[Science is a body of beliefs in itself]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">57</mark>\n\nWhacko science.

Who in this world is more specific than the Internal Revenue Service? As Kluckhohn kept saying, values are not the least vague when you’re dealing with them in terms of actual experience.

It’s a collection of the most general statements of a hierarchical structure of thought. On one of his slips he had copied a definition of it as “that part of philosophy which deals with the nature and structure of reality.” It asks such questions as, “Are the objects we perceive real or illusory? Does the external world exist apart from our consciousness of it? Is reality ultimately reducible to a single underlying substance? If so, is it essentially spiritual or material? Is the universe intelligible and orderly or incomprehensible and chaotic?”\n- [[metaphysics are a collection of the most general statements of a hierarchical structure of thought]]\n- [[Are the objects we perceive real or illusory?|Are the objects we perceive real or illusory?]]\n- [[Does the external world exist apart from our consciousness of it?|Does the external world exist apart from our consciousness of it?]]\n- [[Is reality ultimately reducible to a single underlying substance?|Is reality ultimately reducible to a single underlying substance?]]\n- [[Is the universe esssentially composed of mind, matter, or both?|Is the universe esssentially composed of mind, matter, or both?]]\n- [[Is the universe orderly and determined, or stochastic and chaotic?|Is the universe orderly and determined, or stochastic and chaotic?]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">65</mark>\nSome of the most honored philosophers in history have been mystics: Plotinus, Swedenborg, Loyola, Shankaracharya and many others. They share a common belief that the fundamental nature of reality is outside language; that language splits things up into parts while the true nature of reality is undivided.\n\n*this ties into sapolskys bins and goes against the analytic knife*\n\n- [[famous mystics]]\n- [[Pirsig thinks the way we categorize the world is most important, while Sapolsky says they should merely be convenient platforms]]\n- [[Mystics say that the fundamental nature of reality is outside language]]\n\n\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">65</mark>\n\nHistorically mystics have claimed that for a true understanding of reality metaphysics is too “scientific.” Metaphysics is not reality. Metaphysics is names about reality. Metaphysics is a restaurant where they give you a thirty-thousand-page menu and no food.\n- [[Mystics think metaphysics is names about reality]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">65</mark>\n\nMystics will tell you that once you’ve opened the door to metaphysics you can say good-bye to any genuine understanding of reality. Thought is not a path to reality. It sets obstacles in that path because when you try to use thought to approach something that is prior to thought your thinking does not carry you toward that something. It carries you away from it. To define something is to subordinate it to a tangle of intellectual relationships. And when you do that you destroy real understand\n- [[You cannot approach reality through thought, because reality is prior to thought.]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">66</mark>\n\nQuality doesn’t have to be defined. You understand it without definition, ahead of definition. Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions.\n- [[Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">67</mark>\n\nAs long as you’re inside a logical, coherent universe of thought you can’t escape metaphysics.

It sharply distinguishes between fact and value, and is hostile to religion and traditional metaphysics. It is an outgrowth of empiricism, the idea that all knowledge must come from experience, and is suspicious of any thought, even a scientific statement, that is incapable of being reduced to direct observation.\n\nthis is ver much my experience s far. science is tedious and slow and to a degree it stops original thought with the voice inyour head going \"you dont have a source forthat\"\n- [[science is an outgrowth of empiricism]]\n- [[Empiricism says all knowledge must come from experience]]\n- [[All well-supported sentences have sources, but not all sentences with sources are well-supported]]\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">67</mark>\n\nBut the answer to all this, he thought, was that a ruthless, doctrinaire avoidance of degeneracy is a degeneracy of another sort. That’s the degeneracy fanatics are made of. Purity, identified, ceases to be purity. Objections to pollution are a form of pollution.\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">68</mark>\n\nAny person of any philosophic persuasion who sits on a hot stove will verify without any intellectual argument whatsoever that he is in an undeniably low-quality situation: that the value of his predicament is negative.\n\nsimilar to sam harris moral absolutism\n- [[Pirsig avoids the is-ought problem by saying all that exists are ought statements in the form of value patterns]]\n\n68\n\nhave a culturally inherited blind spot here. Our culture teaches us to think it is the hot stove that directly causes the oaths. It teaches that the low values are a property of the person uttering the oaths.  \nNot so. The value is between the stove and the oaths. Between the subject and the object lies the value. This value is more immediate, more directly sensed than any “self” or any “object” to which it might be later assigned. It is more real than the stove. Whether the stove is the cause of the low quality or whether possibly something else is the cause is not yet absolutely certain. But that the quality is low is absolutely certain. It is the primary empirical reality from which such things as stoves and heat and oaths and self are later intellectually constructed.\n\nimportant. als tiesino the kant quote from ZAM\n\n68\n\nThe Metaphysics of Quality restates the empirical basis of logical positivism with more precision, more inclusiveness, more explanatory power than it has previously had. It says that values are not outside of the experience that logical positivism limits itself to. They are the essence of this experience. Values are more empirical, in fact, than subjects or objects.\n\ni guess it will become clear but i wonder if thi means that the scientific method is a way of \"verifying\" high Quality orderings of reality?\n\n69\n\nHe picked up the slips on Dusenberry,\n\neve pirsig utilized som kin of zettelkasten\n\n77\n\n“May I come out and fight?” the author said. “My exact statement was that people do disagree as to what Quality is, but their disagreement is only on the objects in which they think Quality inheres.”  \n“What’s the difference?”  \n“Quality, on which there is complete agreement, is a universal source of things. The objects about which people disagree are merely transitory.”\n\npinions are different ideaa of what constitutes Quality?\n\n84\n\nHundreds of years ago these old waterways were the only way to travel in this continent. For a while he had wondered why his boat always seemed to stop in the oldest part of each city it came to, and then he realized that small boats stopping right there is what got the city started in the first place.\n\n93\n\nInvoluted\n\n(a.) Rolled inward from the edges; -said of leaves in vernation, or of the petals of flowers in aestivation.  \n(a.) Rolled inward spirally.\n\n94\n\nPuritan\n\n(n.) One who, in the time of Queen Elizabeth and the first two Stuarts, opposed traditional and formal usages, and advocated simpler forms of faith and worship than those established by law; -originally, a term of reproach. The Puritans formed the bulk of the early population of New England.  \n(n.) One who is scrupulous and strict in his religious life; -often used reproachfully or in contempt; one who has overstrict notions.\n\n95\n\nBecause Quality is morality. Make no mistake about it. They’re identical. And if Quality is the primary reality of the world then that means morality is also the primary reality of the world. The world is primarily a moral order. But it’s a moral order that neither Rigel nor the posing Victorians had ever, in their wildest dreams, thought about or heard about.\n\n96\n\nThe idea that the world is composed of nothing but moral value sounds impossible at first. Only objects are supposed to be real. “Quality” is supposed to be just a vague fringe word that tells what we think about objects. The whole idea that Quality can create objects seems very wrong. But we see subjects and objects as reality for the same reason we see the world right-side up although the lenses of our eyes actually present it to our brains upside down. We get so used to certain patterns of interpretation we forget the patterns are there.\n\nie the raw world, before interpretation, although unknowable unlike the upside world, has not been divided into objects yet, bc that is where Quality comes in.\n- [[We get so used to certain patterns of interpretation we forget the patterns are even there]]\n\n96\n\nThe same is true of subjects and objects. The culture in which we live hands us a set of intellectual glasses to interpret experience with, and the concept of the primacy of subjects and objects is built right into these glasses. If someone sees things through a somewhat different set of glasses or, God help him, takes his glasses off, the natural tendency of those who still have their glasses on is to regard his statements as somewhat weird, if not actually crazy.  \nBut he isn’t. The idea that values create objects gets less and less weird as you get used to it. Modern physics on the other hand gets more and more weird as you get into it and indications are that this weirdness will increase. In either case, however, weirdness isn’t the test of truth. As Einstein said, common sense—non-weirdness—is just a bundle of prejudices acquired before the age of eighteen. The tests of truth are logical consistency, agreement with experience, and economy of explanation. The Metaphysics of Quality satisfies these.\n\n97\n\nis not subjective. The low value comes first, then the subjective thoughts that include such things as stove and heat and pain come second. The value is the reality that brings the thoughts to mind.\n\ni really dont understand this yet… how is it not the hotness of the stove leading t the low value, ie the property of the stove as experienced by a subject?\n\n97\n\na thing that has no value does not exist.\n\ni really wonder what pirsig would say about the value that makes a dog a dog, or like the classic philosophical contention of \"tafeligheid\"\n\n98\n\ncould they be?  \nPersons who know the history of science will recognize the sweet smell of phlogiston here and the warm glow of the luminiferous ether, two other scientific entities which were arrived at deductively and which never showed up under the microscope or anywhere else. When deduced entities are around for years and nobody finds them it is a sign that the deductions have been made from false premises; that the body of theory from which the deductions are made is wrong at some fundamental level.\n- [[Wrong deductions are deduced from faulty logic or false premises]]\n\n98\n\nThe mechanism for holding these values is completely unknown.\n\nwell, how about evolutionary biology and the \"endure and prevail\" maxim? i would say that explains a great deal of why hot stoves are low value\n\n99\n\nThis problem of trying to describe value in terms of substance has been the problem of a smaller container trying to contain a larger one. Value is not a subspecies of substance. Substance is a subspecies of value. When you reverse the containment process and define substance in terms of value the mystery disappears: substance is a “stable pattern of inorganic values.” The problem then disappears. The world of objects and the world of values is unified.\n- [[A common logical flaw is that of a smaller container trying to contain a larger one]]\n\n99\n\nanimals. Even today you still see occasional articles in nature magazines asking, “Why does this paradox of nature exist?”  \nThe answer is: it doesn’t. The platypus isn’t doing anything paradoxical at all. It isn’t having any problems. Platypi have been laying eggs and suckling their young for millions of years before there were any zoologists to come along and declare it illegal. The real mystery, the real enigma, is how mature, objective, trained scientific observers can blame their own goof on a poor innocent platypus.\n\n100\n\nrelation of mind to matter, of the discontinuity of matter at the subatomic level, of the apparent purposelessness of the universe and the life within it are all monster platypi created by the subject-object metaphysics.\n\n100\n\nThe world comes to us in an endless stream of puzzle pieces that we would like to think all fit together somehow, but that in fact never do. There are always some pieces like platypi that don’t fit and we can either ignore these pieces or we can give them silly explanations or we can take the whole puzzle apart and try other ways of assembling it that will include more of them. When one takes the whole ill-shaped, misfitting structure of a subject-object explained universe apart and puts it back together in a value-centered metaphysics, all kinds of orphaned puzzle pieces fit beautifully that never fit before.\n\n101\n\nmust equal whole forests of pulpwood.  \nIn the Metaphysics of Quality “causation” is a metaphysical term that can be replaced by “value.” To say that “A causes B” or to say that “B values precondition A” is to say the same thing. The difference is one of words only. Instead of saying “A magnet causes iron filings to move toward it,” you can say “Iron filings value movement toward a magnet.” Scientifically speaking neither statement is more true than the other. It may sound a little awkward, but that’s a matter of linguistic custom, not science. The language used to describe the data is changed but the scientific data itself is unchanged.\n\ni do wonder how that brings us closer to understanding casation\n\n101\n\nWithin a Metaphysics of Quality, science is a set of static intellectual patterns describing this reality, but the patterns are not the reality they describe.\n\nbc any attempt to describe reality falls short bc it uses language and bc it is an apprximatn of the real thing\n\n101\n\nThe only difference between causation and value is that the word “cause” implies absolute certainty whereas the implied meaning of “value” is one of preference. In classical science it was supposed that the world always works in terms of absolute certainty and that “cause” is the more appropriate word to describe it. But in modern quantum physics all that is changed. Particles “prefer” to do what they do. An individual particle is not absolutely committed to one predictable behavior. What appears to be an absolute cause is just a very consistent pattern of preferences. Therefore when you strike “cause” from the language and substitute “value” you are not only replacing an empirically meaningless term with a meaningful one; you are using a term that is more appropriate to actual observation.\n\nso i think here ppear the dfferent kinds of quality/value that yt talk spoke about. this is evidently a physical kind of value.\n\n101\n\nBookmark\n\n102\n\nplatypus. Strike out the word “substance” wherever it appears and substitute the expression “stable inorganic pattern of value.”\n\n102\n\ndata are exactly the same.  \nThe greatest benefit of this substitution of “value” for “causation” and “substance” is that it allows an integration of physical science with other areas of experience that have been traditionally considered outside the scope of scientific thought. Phædrus saw that the “value” which directed subatomic particles is not identical with the “value” a human being gives to a painting. But he saw that the two are cousins, and that the exact relationship between them can be defined with great precision. Once this definition is complete a huge integration of the humanities and sciences appears in which platypi fall by the hundreds. Thousands.\n\nanswers a lot of questions\n\n104\n\nin which the first division of Quality—the first slice of undivided experience—is into subjects and objects. Once you have made that slice, all of human experience is supposed to fit into one of these two boxes. The\n\npretty nice summary of metaphysics\n\n105\n\nNo matter what position you take on a metaphysical question someone will always start asking questions that will lead to more positions that lead to more questions in this endless intellectual chess game.\n\n105\n\ngame. The game is supposed to stop when it is agreed that a particular line of reasoning is illogical. This is supposed to be similar to a checkmate. But conflicting positions go on for centuries\n\n105\n\nspent trying to lay down a first line of division between the classic and romantic aspects of the universe he’d emphasized in his first book. In that book his purpose had been to show how Quality could unite the two. But the fact that Quality was the best way of uniting the two was no guarantee that the reverse was true—that the classic-romantic split was the best way of dividing Quality. It wasn’t.\n\n112\n\nearlier example was now given some added meaning by a static-Dynamic division of Quality. When the person who sits on the stove first discovers his low-Quality situation, the front edge of his experience is Dynamic. He does not think, “This stove is hot,” and then make a rational decision to get off. A “dim perception of he knows not what” gets him off Dynamically. Later he generates static patterns of thought to explain the situation.\n\n<mark style=\"background: #BBFABBA6;\">114</mark>\n==Zettelfied==\n\ncome to see that the same kind of division between Dynamic Quality and static quality that exists in the field of morals also exists in the field of art.\n\nisntthis also on a spectrum though? from static to dynamic. ie there is an idea of quality that IS and an ever-changing conception of what might in time become static. there is a difference because there is a delay in the transformation from dynamic to static, which i why multiple conceptions of it can exist concurrently\n\n114\n\nDynamic Quality comes as a sort of surprise.\n\nit is like \"prerendered\" value like in a game, it is not yet expected until it renders fully\n\n114\n\nthe train at New Rochelle has had all his static patterns shattered, he can’t find them, and in that moment only Dynamic Quality is available to him. That is why he gazes at his own hand with a sense of wonder and delight.\n\nthis may also be useful in expaining the psychedelic experience\n\n114\n\nIt was in an essay by Walker Percy called “The Delta Factor.” It asked,  \nWhy is a man apt to feel bad in a good environment, say suburban Short Hills, New Jersey, on an ordinary Wednesday afternoon? Why is the same man apt to feel good in a very bad environment, say in an old hotel in Key Largo, in a hurricane.… Why is it that a man riding a good commuter train from Larchmont to New York, whose needs and drives are satisfied, who has a good home, loving wife and family, good job, and enjoys unprecedented “cultural and recreational facilities” often feels bad without knowing why?  \nWhy is it that if such a man suffers a heart attack and, taken off the train at New Rochelle, regains consciousness and finds himself in a strange place, he then comes to himself for the first time in years, perhaps in his life, and begins to gaze at his own hand with a sense of wonder and delight?\n\n117\n\nSlowly at first, and then with increasing awareness that he was going in a right direction, Phædrus’s central attention turned away from any further explanation of Dynamic Quality and turned toward the static patterns themselves.\n\ncurious to see where he will take this. is he going to define static quality by subdividing it into sth like organic quality? perhaps he will make the point that organic quality i less subject to dynamic quality than, say, mora values, which is less subject to it than, say, taste.\n\n117\n\ncumb to death, since that which does not change cannot live. But now he was beginning to see that this radical bias weakened his own case. Life can’t exist on Dynamic Quality alone. It has no staying power. To cling to Dynamic Quality alone apart from any static patterns is to cling to chaos. He saw that much can be learned about Dynamic Quality by studying what it is not rather than futilely trying to define what it is.  \nStatic quality patterns are dead when they are exclusive, when they demand blind obedience and suppress Dynamic change. But static patterns, nevertheless, provide a necessary stabilizing force to protect Dynamic progress from degeneration. Although Dynamic Quality, the Quality of freedom, creates this world in which we live, these patterns of static quality, the quality of order, preserve our world. Neither static nor Dynamic Quality can survive without the other.  \nIf one inserts this concept into a case such as that of the brujo in Zuñi, one can see the truth of it. Although the Dynamic brujo and the static priests who tortured him appeared to be mortal enemies, they were actually necessary to each other. Both types of people had to exist. If most of Zuñi went around drunk and bragging and looking in windows, that ancient way of life could never have lasted. But without wild, disreputable outcasts like the brujo, ready to seize on any new outside idea and bring it into the community, Zuni would have been too inflexible to survive. A tension between these two forces is needed to continue the evolution of life.\n\n121\n\n“Something is happening right now and you think it’s unimportant because you’ve never seen a movie of it.\n\n130\n\nZen verse by Mumon:  \nDoes Lila have Quality?  \nThat’s the most important question of all.  \nBut if you answer “yes” or you answer “no,”  \nYou lose your own Quality.\n\n131\n\nLila is composed of static patterns of value and these patterns are evolving toward a Dynamic Quality. That’s the theory, anyway. She’s on her way somewhere, just like everybody else. And you can’t say where that somewhere is.\n\n131\n\nIt was too contrived, too full of objective “observational” stuff. It ignored the whole Dynamic aspect. There is always this open end of Dynamic indeterminacy. It would be impossible to predict anything from what she said.\n\n132\n\nSo today we have as a result a theory of evolution in which “man” is ruthlessly controlled by the cause-and-effect laws of the universe while the particles of his body are not. The absurdity of this seems to be neglected. The problem doesn’t lie in anyone’s department. Physicists can ignore it because they are not concerned with man. Social scientists can ignore it because they are not concerned with subatomic particles.\n\n133\n\ncompounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen struggle for billions of years to organize themselves into a professor of chemistry? What’s the motive?\n\nendure and prevail, combined with the haphazard ocurrence of a self-replicating molecule biased towards more complx versions of itself.\n\n134\n\nIn a metaphysics in which static universal laws are considered fundamental, the idea that life is evolving away from any law just draws a baffled question mark.\n\ni think he will argue that as life becomes more complex it is more governed by its own rules than by the \"static\" laws of nature (ie comparing bacteria to ants to humans)\n\n134\n\nTeleology\n\n(n.) The doctrine of the final causes of things  \n(n.) the doctrine of design, which assumes that the phenomena of organic life, particularly those of evolution, are explicable only by purposive causes, and that they in no way admit of a mechanical explanation or one based entirely on biological science; the doctrine of adaptation to purpose.\n\n135\n\nDynamic Quality, the source of all things, the pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality, always appears as “spur of the moment.” Where else could it appear?\n\n137\n\nThe “undefined fittest” they are defending is identical to Dynamic Quality. Natural selection is Dynamic Quality at work. There is no quarrel whatsoever between the Metaphysics of Quality and the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. Neither is there a quarrel between the Metaphysics of Quality and the “teleological” theories which insist that life has some purpose. What the Metaphysics of Quality has done is unite these opposed doctrines within a larger metaphysical structure that accommodates both of them without contradiction.\n\n137\n\nThe explanation of life as a “migration of static patterns toward Dynamic Quality” not only fitted the known facts of evolution, it allowed new ways of interpreting them.\n\n137\n\nBookmark\n\n139\n\nplasticlike molecule called protein, surrounds the Dynamic one and prevents attack by forces of light, heat and other chemicals that would prey on its sensitivity and destroy it. The Dynamic one, called DNA, reciprocates by telling the static one what to do, replacing the static one when it wears out, replacing itself even when it hasn’t worn out, and changing its own nature to overcome adverse conditions. These two kinds of molecules, working together, are all there is in some viruses, which are the simplest forms of life.  \nThis division of all biological evolutionary patterns into a Dynamic function and a static function continues on up through higher levels of evolution. The formation of semipermeable cell walls to let food in and keep poisons out is a static latch. So are bones, shells, hide, fur, burrows, clothes, houses, villages, castles, rituals, symbols, laws and libraries. All of these prevent evolutionary degeneration.\n\nat this point i really wonder if antonio damazio was inspired by pirsig, which could very well have been the case considering pirsigs books are way older and ZAM is very popular.\n\n140\n\nSo are sexual choice, symbiosis, death and regeneration, communality, communication, speculative thought, curiosity and art. Most of these, when viewed in a substance-centered evolutionary way, are thought of as mere incidental properties of the molecular machine. But in a value-centered explanation of evolution they are close to the Dynamic process itself, pulling the pattern of life forward to greater levels of versatility and freedom.\n\nit is kinda confusing to me how at first i thought static meant status quo but now it als means \"protective\", eg bones and fur. at some point in time, no organism had bones, so at the firzt occurrence, wouldnt it be dynamic quality, ie innovation?\n\n140\n\nWithout Dynamic Quality the organism cannot grow. Without static quality the organism cannot last. Both are needed.\n\nendure is static, prevail is dynamic\n\n140\n\nNow when we come to the chemistry professor, and see him studying his empirically gathered data, trying to figure out what it means, this person makes more sense. He’s not just some impartial visitor from outer space looking in on all this with no purpose other than to observe. Neither is he some static, molecular, objective, biological machine, doing all this for absolutely no purpose whatsoever. We see that he’s conducting his experiments for exactly the same purpose as the subatomic forces had when they first began to create him billions of years ago. He’s looking for information that will expand the static patterns of evolution itself and give both greater versatility and greater stability against hostile static forces of nature. He may have personal motives such as “pure fun,” that is, the Dynamic Quality of his work. But when he applies for funds he will normally and properly tie his request to some branch of humanity’s overall evolutionary purpose.\n\n141\n\nPhædrus had once called metaphysics “the high country of the mind”—an analogy to the “high country” of mountain climbing. It takes a lot of effort to get there and more effort when you arrive, but unless you can make the journey you are confined to one valley of thought all your life.\n\ni feel like the part where he spoke on mysticism and how any true understanding of reality should precede thought and language because those are limited modes of understanding compared to pure experienc, is my high country. Also, it makes me wonder whether I should pick up some kind of medtation practice, as well as read Eckhart Tolle.\n\n141\n\nare divided into four systems: inorganic patterns, biological patterns, social patterns and intellectual patterns. They are exhaustive. That’s all there are. If you construct an encyclopedia of four topics—Inorganic, Biological, Social and Intellectual—nothing is left out. No “thing,” that is. Only Dynamic Quality, which cannot be described in any encyclopedia, is absent.  \nBut although the four systems are exhaustive they are not exclusive. They all operate at the same time and in ways that are almost independent of each other.  \nThis classification of patterns is not very original, but the Metaphysics of Quality allows an assertion about them that is unusual. It says they are not continuous. They are discrete. They have very little to do with one another. Although each higher level is built on a lower one it is not an extension of that lower level. Quite the contrary. The higher level can often be seen to be in opposition to the lower level, dominating it, controlling it where possible for its own purposes.  \nThis observation is impossible in a substance-dominated metaphysics where everything has to be an extension of matter. But now atoms and molecules are just one of four levels of static patterns of quality and there is no intellectual requirement that any level dominate the other three.\n\n142\n\nEverything was seen from a pure and symbolic world of logical relationships that had no resemblance at all to the “real” world he had worked in. The Machine Language Instruction Repertoire, which had been the entire design goal, was now the lowest element of the lowest level programming language.\n\nthis relates to the division between the types of static quality (inorganic, organic, social, intellectual), and how the only communicate on a symbolic level.\n\n142\n\nBookmark\n\n143\n\nWhat makes all this significant to the Metaphysics of Quality is its striking parallelism to the interrelationship of different levels of static patterns of quality.\n\ncalled it\n\n143\n\nSimilarly the biological patterns of life and the molecular patterns of organic chemistry have a “machine language” interface called DNA but that does not mean that the carbon or hydrogen or oxygen atoms possess or guide life. A primary occupation of every level of evolution seems to be offering freedom to lower levels of evolution. But as the higher level gets more sophisticated it goes off on purposes of its own.\n\n144\n\nIn a subject-object metaphysics, value has always been the most vague and ambiguous of terms. What is it? When you say the world is composed of nothing but value, what are you talking about?\n\n144\n\nmatter, which creates mind. There is the idealist school that says it is all mind, which creates matter. There is the positivist school which says this argument could go on forever; drop the subject.\n\n144\n\nAnd they are completely different from the biological pattern that can cause the most skeptical of intellectuals to leap from a hot stove.\n\nas alwas, how about the edge cases, ie this is a spectrum: how about the disgust felt at forcing a woman to marry? Or the adrenaline rush felt when you see someone kicking a dog? both seem social AND biological to some extent\n\n145\n\nsame four static patterns as the Metaphysics of Quality, dividing them into two groups of two: inorganic-biological patterns called “matter,” and social-intellectual patterns called “mind.” But this division is the source of the problem. When a subject-object metaphysics regards matter and mind as eternally separate and eternally unalike, it creates a platypus bigger than the solar system.  \nIt has to make this fatal division because it gives top position in its structure to subjects and objects. Everything has got to be object or subject, substance or non-substance, because that’s the primary division of the universe. Inorganic-biological patterns are composed of “substance,” and are therefore “objective.” Social-intellectual patterns are not composed of “substance” and are therefore called “subjective.” Then, having made this arbitrary division based on “substance,” conventional metaphysics then asks, “What is the relationship between mind and matter, between subject and object?”\n\nto me it appears likely that the reason for the subject object split is bc we have senses, ie were biased towards thinking it must all be things that sense (subjects) or the things they sense (objects).\n\n146\n\nScience and reason, this myth goes, come only from the objective world, never from the social world. The world of objects imposes itself upon the mind with no social mediation whatsoever. It is easy to see the historic reasons for this myth of independence. Science might never have survived without it. But a close examination shows it isn’t so.\n\n147\n\nwhich is undefinable, one’s behavior is free.\n\nrandomness/undefinability doesnt equate to freedom right?\n\n147\n\nThis battle has been a very long and very loud one because an abandonment of either position has devastating logical consequences. If the belief in free will is abandoned, morality must seemingly also be abandoned under a subject-object metaphysics. If man follows the cause-and-effect laws of substance, then man cannot really choose between right and wrong.  \nOn the other hand, if the determinists let go of their position it would seem to deny the truth of science. If one adheres to a traditional scientific metaphysics of substance, the philosophy of determinism is an inescapable corollary. If “everything” is included in the class of “substance and its properties,” and if “substance and its properties” is included in the class of “things that always follow laws,” and if “people” are included in the class “everything,” then it is an air-tight logical conclusion that people always follow the laws of substance.\n\non determinism\n\n148\n\nSo what Phædrus was saying was that not just life, but everything, is an ethical activity. It is nothing else. When inorganic patterns of reality create life the Metaphysics of Quality postulates that they’ve done so because it’s “better” and that this definition of “betterness”—this beginning response to Dynamic Quality—is an elementary unit of ethics upon which all right and wrong can be based.\n\n148\n\nIt was, for him, a great Dynamic breakthrough, but if he wanted to hang on to it he had better do some static latching as quickly and thoroughly as possible.\n\n149\n\nWith static patterns of value divided into four systems, conventional moral patterns have almost nothing to do with inorganic or biological nature. These moral patterns are superimposed upon inorganic nature the way novels are superimposed upon computers. They\n\nlike how harari talks about cultural evolution after biological evolution.\n\n149\n\nWhat the evolutionary structure of the Metaphysics of Quality shows is that there is not just one moral system. There are many. In the Metaphysics of Quality there’s the morality called the “laws of nature,” by which inorganic patterns triumph over chaos; there is a morality called the “law of the jungle” where biology triumphs over the inorganic forces of starvation and death; there’s a morality where social patterns triumph over biology, “the law”; and there is an intellectual morality, which is still struggling in its attempts to control society. Each of these sets of moral codes is no more related to the other than novels are to flip-flops.\n\nthe big question remaining is: how are these different kinds of values decided on?\n\n149\n\nare more commonly opposed to biological patterns than they are supportive of them.\n\n+\n\n150\n\nIn the moral evolutionary conflict between the germ and the patient, the evolutionary spread is enormous and as a result the morality of the situation is obvious. But when the static patterns in conflict are closer the moral force of the situation becomes less obvious.\n\nG\n\n150\n\na moral pattern of reality as real as H2O.\n\nisnt this moral pattern itself a value? Why dont we prefer lower value classes?\n\n150\n\nevolutionary morality, on the other hand, would say it’s scientifically immoral for everyone because animals are at a higher level of evolution, that is, more Dynamic, than are grains and fruits and vegetables.\n\nA. but wht if animal are helthier?\n\n150\n\nall other things being equal, that choice which is more Dynamic, that is, at a higher level of evolution, is more moral. An example of this is the statement that, “It’s more moral for a doctor to kill a germ than to allow the germ to kill his patient.” The germ wants to live. The patient wants to live. But the patient has moral precedence because he’s at a higher level of evolution.\n\nA. such an approach seems very human centric, but i guess such an argument is valid in a way bc animals also have social values, which are clearly built on \"lower\" biological values of which the germs are a part. But what to do whe both parties are of the same value layer? Also, this is not really a pressing moral issue.\n\n151\n\nJust as it is more moral for a doctor to kill a germ than a patient, so it is more moral for an idea to kill a society than it is for a society to kill an idea.\n\nwhat if there is overlap tho, ie a very high value spcoety may have higher value than a mediocre idea.  \n  \nhonestly the firther i get the ore hi value structure appears lik ust another wa the analytic knife can cut √ relate this to the part about mrtaphysics bein degeerate\n\n151\n\nmarching on.  \nWhen a society is not itself threatened, as in the execution of individual criminals, the issue becomes more complex. In the case of treason or insurrection or war a criminal’s threat to a society can be very real. But if an established social structure is not seriously threatened by a criminal, then an evolutionary morality would argue that there is no moral justification for killing him.\n\ni think yhis illustrates ho this value structure solves very few actual problems\n\n152\n\nEvolutionary morality\n\njust heads up: i like concepts value, evplutionary morality and the different types of value. not his usage tho and his examples as som great solution to moral questions.\n\n152\n\nAnd beyond that is an even more compelling reason: societies and thoughts and principles themselves are no more than sets of static patterns. These patterns can’t by themselves perceive or adjust to Dynamic Quality. Only a living being can do that. The strongest moral argument against capital punishment is that it weakens a society’s Dynamic capability—its capability for change and evolution. It’s not the “nice” guys who bring about real social change. “Nice” guys look nice because they’re conforming. It’s the “bad” guys, who only look nice a hundred years later, that are the real Dynamic force in social evolution.\n\nwht?? ho about hitler… not all dynamic chage s better ie higer value than static value  \n  \nthe part abt dynamic Q and only humans being only to do it s good\n\n153\n\nRigel was just pushing a narrow tradition-bound sociobiological code of morals which it was certain he didn’t understand himself.\n\nwell no, mb hes arguin that social values are highrr than biologcal ones\n\n154\n\nVice\n\n(n.) A defect; a fault; an error; a blemish; an imperfection; as, the vices of a political constitution; the vices of a horse.  \n(n.) A moral fault or failing; especially, immoral conduct or habit, as in the indulgence of degrading appetites; customary deviation in a single respect, or in general, from a right standard, implying a defect of natural character, or the result of training and habits; a harmful custom; immorality; depravity; wickedness; as, a life of vice; the vice of intemperance.\n\n154\n\nhold one level of organization together are often the same patterns that another level of organization must fight to maintain its own existence. Morality is not a simple set of rules. It’s a very complex struggle of conflicting patterns of values. This conflict is the residue of evolution. As new patterns evolve they come into conflict with old ones. Each stage of evolution creates in its wake a wash of problems.  \nIt’s out of this struggle between conflicting static patterns that the concepts of good and evil arise. Thus, the evil of disease which the doctor is absolutely morally committed to stop is not an evil at all within the germ’s lower static pattern of morality. The germ is making a moral effort to stave off its own destruction by lower-level inorganic forces of evil.\n\n154\n\nFirst, there were moral codes that established the supremacy of biological life over inanimate nature. Second, there were moral codes that established the supremacy of the social order over biological life—conventional morals—proscriptions against drugs, murder, adultery, theft and the like. Third, there were moral codes that established the supremacy of the intellectual order over the social order—democracy, trial by jury, freedom of speech, freedom of the press. Finally there’s a fourth Dynamic morality which isn’t a code. He supposed you could call it a “code of Art” or something like that, but art is usually thought of as such a frill that that title undercuts its importance. The morality of the brujo in Zuñi—that was Dynamic morality.\n\ndynamic is fourth ie the highest\n\n156\n\nIntellect is not an extension of society any more than society is an extension of biology. Intellect is going its own way, and in doing so is at war with society, seeking to subjugate society, to put society under lock and key.\n\ni think u could ake an argument that society ad intellect wor synergestically, horizonaly, not vertically\n\n156\n\nJust as a society that weakens its people’s physical health endangers its own stability, so does an intellectual pattern that weakens and destroys the health of its social base also endanger its own stability.\n\nand vice versa?\n\n163\n\n‘Tristes tropiques,’ the anthropologist, Lévi-Strauss,\n\n164\n\n“What holds a person together is his patterns of likes and dislikes,” he said. “And what holds a society together is a pattern of likes and dislikes. And what holds the whole world together is patterns of likes and dislikes.\n\n165\n\nyou think is just you but actually the language you use and the values you have are the result of thousands of years of cultural evolution. It’s all in a kind of debris of pieces that seem unrelated but are actually part of a huge fabric.\n\n165\n\n“Have you ever heard of Heinrich Schliemann?” he asked.  \n“Heinrich Who?”  \n“He was an archaeologist who investigated the ruins of a city people thought was mythological: ancient Troy.  \n“Before Schliemann used what he called the stratographic technique, archaeologists were just educated grave-robbers. He showed how you could dig down carefully through one stratum after another, finding the ruins of earlier cities under later ones.\n\ncool!\n\n165\n\nLévi-Strauss postulates that a culture can only be understood by reenacting its thought processes with the debris of its interaction with other cultures.\n\nlacan also mentions this guy\n\n165\n\n“You’re sort of another culture,” he said. “A culture of one. A culture is an evolved static pattern of quality capable of Dynamic change. That’s what you are. That’s the best definition of you that’s ever been invented.\n\n177\n\nThat’s what an archaeologist is, really—a highly trained garbage man. You see all the great finds in museums. You don’t see what they had to go through to find them.…\n\n181\n\nThe intelligence of the mind can’t think of any reason to live, but it goes on anyway because the intelligence of the cells can’t think of any reason to die.\n\nbiological vs intellectual value conflict\n\n182\n\nAt this moment, asleep, “Lila” doesn’t exist any more than a program exists when a computer is switched off. The intelligence of her cells had switched Lila off for the night, exactly the way a hardware switch turns off a computer program.  \nThe language we’ve inherited confuses this.\n\n183\n\nchange, life sat around for three billion years, doing almost no changing at all. It was sexual selection that shot it forward into the animals and plants we have today. A bacterium gets no choice in what its progeny are going to be, but a queen bee gets to select from thousands of drones. That selection is Dynamic. In all sexual selection, Lila chooses, Dynamically, the individual she wants to project into the future. If he excites her sense of Quality she joins him to perpetuate him into another generation, and he lives on. But if he’s unable to convince her of his Quality—if he’s sick or deformed or unable to satisfy her in some way—she refuses to join him and his deformity is not carried on.\n\n184\n\nAscetic\n\n(a.) Extremely rigid in self-denial and devotions; austere; severe.  \n(n.) In the early church, one who devoted himself to a solitary and contemplative life, characterized by devotion, extreme self-denial, and self-mortification; a hermit; a recluse; hence, one who practices extreme rigor and self-denial in religious things.\n\n193\n\nZen shoshin, the “beginner’s mind’.…\n\n194\n\nShe’s after Quality, like everybody else, but she defines it entirely in biological terms. She doesn’t see intellectual quality at all. It’s outside her range. She doesn’t even see social quality.\n\n195\n\nHe had come to think of dreams as Dynamic perceptions of reality. They were suppressed and filtered out of consciousness by conventional patterns of static social and intellectual order but they revealed a primary truth: a value truth. The static patterns of the dreams were false but the underlying values that produced the patterns were true. In static reality there is no octopus coming to squeeze us to death, no giant that is going to devour us and digest us and turn us into a part of its own body so that it can grow stronger and stronger while we are dissolved and lost into nothingness.  \nBut in Dynamic reality?\n\n196\n\nIt was spooky how it all worked with an intelligence of its own that was way beyond the intelligence of any person. He would never know how to fix one of these systems of wire and tubes down below the ground that ran it all. Yet there was someone who did. And there was a system for finding that person if he was needed, and a system for finding that system that would find him. The cohesive force that held all these systems together: that was the Giant.  \nWhen he was young Phædrus used to think about cows and pigs and chickens and how they never knew that the nice farmer who provided food and shelter was doing so only so that he could sell them to be killed and eaten. They would “oink,” or “cluck,” and he would come with food, so they probably thought he was some sort of servant.  \nHe also used to wonder if there was a higher farmer that did the same thing to people, a different kind of organism that they saw every day and thought of as beneficial, providing food and shelter and protection from enemies, but an organism that secretly was raising these people for its own sustenance, feeding upon them and using their accumulated energy for its own independent purposes. Later he saw there was: this Giant. People look upon the social patterns of the Giant in the same way cows and horses look upon a farmer; different from themselves, incomprehensible, but benevolent and appealing. Yet the social pattern of the city devours their lives for its own purposes just as surely as farmers devour the flesh of farm animals. A higher organism is feeding upon a lower one and accomplishing more by doing so than the lower organism can accomplish alone.  \nThe metaphysics of substance makes it difficult to see the Giant. It makes it customary to think of a city like New York as a “work of man,” but what man invented it? What group of men invented it? Who sat around and thought up how it should all go together?  \nIf “man” invented societies and cities, why are all societies and cities so repressive of “man”? Why would “man” want to invent internally contradictory standards and arbitrary social institutions for the purpose of giving himself a bad time? This “man” who goes around inventing societies to repress himself seems real as long as you deal with him in the abstract, but he evaporates as you get more specific.  \nSometimes people think there are some evil individual “men” somewhere who are exploiting them, some secret cabal of capitalists, or “400,” or “Wall Street bankers,” or WASPs or name-any-minority group that gets together periodically and has secret conferences on how to exploit them personally. These “men” are supposed to be enemies of “man.” It gets confusing, but nobody seems to notice the confusion.  \nA metaphysics of substance\n\n197\n\nJust as a farmer raises cows for the sole purpose of devouring them, this pattern grows living human bodies for the sole purpose of devouring them. That is what the Giant really does.\n\nTHE GIANT IS MOLOCH\n\n197\n\nA metaphysics of substance makes us think that all evolution stops with the highest evolved substance, the physical body of man. It makes us think that cities and societies and thought structures are all subordinate creations of this physical body of man. But it’s as foolish to think of a city or a society as created by human bodies as it is to think of human bodies as a creation of the cells, or to think of cells as created by protein and DNA molecules, or to think of DNA as created by carbon and other inorganic atoms.\n\n198\n\nThis was the brain center of that corporate network, surrounded by other networks: financial networks, information networks, electronic transmission networks. That’s what all those tiny bodies were doing up there suspended so many hundreds of feet up in the sky. Participating in the Giant.\n\nL. again, these are good examples but they are not definite nor exhaustive. that just depends on how the analytic knife cuts.\n\n199\n\ndon’t need to run from it. In recent years each time he’d returned to New York he could feel his fear of this old monster lessening, and a kind of familiar affection for it growing.\n\n200\n\nDynamic institution. What people buy and what people sell, in other words what people value, can never be contained by any intellectual formula. What makes the marketplace work is Dynamic Quality. The market is always changing and the direction of that change can never be predetermined.\n\n201\n\nScience superseded old religious forms, not because what it says is more true in any absolute sense (whatever that is), but because what it says is more Dynamic.\n\nthe general idea of this ties into my ow intuitions about how things that dont change are left behind, ie things go out of fashion, peoples ideas go out of fashion, even the \"public image clock\" that I heard in POM about ho tech companis go out and into public liking. All a sign of lack of dynamic quality.\n\n201\n\nPtolemy was wrong without any willingness to further investigate the subject, then science would have simply become another minor religious creed. But scientific truth has always contained an overwhelming difference from theological truth: it is provisional. Science always contains an eraser, a mechanism whereby new Dynamic insight could wipe out old static patterns without destroying science itself. Thus science, unlike orthodox theology, has been capable of continuous, evolutionary growth. As Phædrus had written on one of his slips, “The pencil is mightier than the pen.”\n\n202\n\nRobert’s Rules of Order that seemed to capture the whole thing in two sentences: No minority has a right to block a majority from conducting the legal business of the organization. No majority has a right to prevent a minority from peacefully attempting to become a majority.\n\n202\n\nWhen you define morality scientifically as that which enhances evolution it sounds as though you have really solved the problem of what morality is. But then when you try to say specifically what is and what isn’t evolution and where evolution is going, you find you are right back in the soup again. The problem is that you can’t really say whether a specific change is evolutionary at the time it occurs. It is only with a century or so of hindsight that it appears evolutionary.\n\nties into some question i had earlier  \n  \nmorality are social valuesthat enhaxd evolution. Also see blue beard altruism on this.\n\n202\n\nIt seems as though a society that is intolerant of all forms of degeneracy shuts off its own Dynamic growth and becomes static. But a society that tolerates all forms of degeneracy degenerates. Either direction can be dangerous. The mechanisms by which a balanced society grows and does not degenerate are difficult, if not impossible, to define.  \nHow can you tell the two directions apart? Both oppose the status quo. Radical idealists and degenerate hooligans sometimes strongly resemble each other.\n\n229\n\nEach person you come to is a different mirror. And since you’re just another person like them maybe you’re just another mirror too, and there’s no way of ever knowing whether your own view of yourself is just another distortion. Maybe all you ever see is reflections. Maybe mirrors are all you ever get. First the mirrors of your parents, then friends and teachers, then bosses and officials, priests and ministers, and maybe writers and painters too. That’s their job too, holding up mirrors.\n\nreally reminds me of Lacan's imaginary self / captive dentification or sth like that.  \n  \nother people offer different ways of viewing yourself (ego) ie mirrors, through the ways they respond to you.  \n  \nif your own self-image is also a mirror, then something deeper must be \"holding\" that mirror, ie the subconscious?\n\n232\n\nEven a policeman’s uniform is a kind of celebrity device so that you will do what he says without questioning him. Without celebrity nobody would take orders from anybody and there would be no way you could get the society to work.\n\nperhaps celebrity means something like status?\n\n232\n\nPerhaps in Homer’s time, when evolution had not yet transcended the social level into the intellectual, the two were the same.\n\ni dont understand the intellectual pattern yet\n\n233\n\nfortune, traditionally paired as twin forces in the Dynamic generation of social value. Both fame and fortune are huge Dynamic parameters that give society its shape and meaning. We have whole departments of universities, in fact, whole colleges, devoted to the study of economics, that is fortune, but what do we have that is similarly devoted to the study of fame? What exactly is the mechanism by which the culture controls the shapes of the mirrors that produce all these different images of celebrity?\n\nmajor social value pattern\n\n233\n\nIn fact, the way political science is taught now, celebrity is made to look incidental to politics. But go to any political gathering and see what’s making it run. Watch the candidates jockey for celebrity. They know what’s making it run.\n\n234\n\nBut it was an assertion of the Metaphysics of Quality that there exists a reality beyond all these social mirrors. That he had explored. In fact there are two levels of reality beyond these mirrors: an intellectual reality and beyond that, a Dynamic reality.\n\nas we read on the next page, the film is social meda while the book is intellectual. this clarifies the distinction a bit. when he decides not to sell the film rights, an intellectual pattern wpuld supersede the social pattern (after all, the pursuit of fame and fortune is social).\n\n235\n\nMoths steer by keeping a constant angle with the sun or the moon, which works because the sun and moon are so far away a constant angle with them is virtually a straight line. But with a close-up light bulb a constant angle makes a circle. That’s what keeps the moths spinning round and round and round. What’s killing the moths is not a Dynamic aspiration for a “higher life.” That’s just Victorian nonsense. It’s a static biological pattern of value. They can’t change.\n\nthis would require learning. is that always intellectual? dogs learn?\n\n239\n\nintellect are patterns of value. They’re real. They’re independent. They’re not properties of “man” any more than cats are the property of cat food or a tree is a property of soil. Biological man does not create his society any more than soil “creates” a tree. The pattern of the tree is dependent upon the minerals in the soil and would die without them, but the tree’s pattern is not created by the soil’s chemical pattern. It is hostile to the soil’s chemical pattern. It “exploits” the soil, “devours” the soil for its own purposes, just as the cat devours the cat food for its own purposes. In this manner biological man is exploited and devoured by social patterns that are essentially hostile to his biological values.  \nThis is also true of intellect and society. Intellect has its own patterns and goals that are as independent of society as society is independent of biology. A value metaphysics makes it possible to see that there’s a conflict between intellect and society that’s just as fierce as the conflict between society and biology or the conflict between biology and death. Biology beat death billions of years ago. Society beat biology thousands of years ago. But intellect and society are still fighting it out, and that is the key to an understanding of both the Victorians and the twentieth century.\n\n239\n\n“Victorian,” as he used the term, is a pattern of social values that was dominant in a period between the American Civil War and World War I, not a biological pattern. Mark Twain’s life coincided with this period but Phædrus didn’t think of him as a Victorian. His stock-in-trade was humor that poked fun at Victorian pompousness. He was a relief from the Victorians. On the other hand, Herbert Hoover and Douglas MacArthur were biologically outside the Victorian period most of their lives. But they were Victorians, nevertheless, because their social values were Victorian.\n\n243\n\nWith Victorian spirits atrophied and their minds hemmed in by social restraints, all avenues to any quality other than social quality were closed. And so this social base which had no intellectual meaning and no biological purpose slowly and helplessly drifted toward its own stupid self-destruction: toward the senseless murder of millions of its own children on the battlefields of World War I.\n\n243\n\nBookmark\n\n243\n\npurposes is a lower form of evolution than a truth that restrains society for its own purposes.\n\ni suppose bc intellectual values are higher than social values?\n\n244\n\nWilson belonged in both worlds, Victorian society and the new intellectual world of the twentieth century: the only university professor ever to be elected president of the United States.\n\n244\n\nPhædrus thought that if he had to pick one day when the shift from social domination of intellect to intellectual domination of society took place, he would pick November 11, 1918, Armistice Day, the end of World War I.\n\n245\n\nFew Victorians suspected what was coming: that within a few years the intellectuals they idealized as the best representatives of their high culture would turn on them and destroy that culture with contempt.\n\ni suspect he will argue that the 20th century struggle between society and intellect did not end with the first world war, but that it has been an ongoing battle.\n\n246\n\nfree love, movies, “modern” art … suddenly the door had been sprung on a Victorian jail of staleness and conformity they had hardly known was there, and the elation at the new technological and social freedom was dizzying. F. Scott Fitzgerald caught the giddy exhilaration of it:  \nThere’d be an orchestra  \nBingo! Bango!  \nPlaying for us  \nTo dance the tango,  \nAnd people would clap  \nWhen we arose,  \nAt her sweet face  \nAnd my new clothes.\n\n246\n\nsociety. In the chaos of social patterns a wild new intellectual experimentation could now take place. Abstract art, discordant music, Freudian psychoanalysis, the Sacco-Vanzetti trial, contempt for alcoholic prohibition.\n\n247\n\nCommunism and socialism, programs for intellectual control over society, were confronted by the reactionary forces of fascism, a program for the social control of intellect.\n\n248\n\nAnd so, from the idea that society is man’s highest achievement, the twentieth century moved to the idea that intellect is man’s highest achievement. Within the academic world everything was blooming. University enrollments zoomed. The Ph.D. was on its way to becoming the ultimate social status symbol.\n\ni do have that feeling, sortof… idk if thats something i should investigate\n\n248\n\nRoosevelt, was turning the whole United States of America over to foreign radicals, “eggheads,” “Commies” and the like. He was a “traitor to his class.”\n\nfunny how the same political tropes have been in use for decades.\n\n249\n\nCultural relativists held that it is unscientific to interpret values in culture B by the values of culture A. It would be wrong for an Australian Bushman anthropologist to come to New York and find people backward and primitive because hardly anyone could throw a boomerang properly. It is equally wrong for a New York anthropologist to go to Australia and find a Bushman backward and primitive because he cannot read or write. Cultures are unique historical patterns which contain their own values and cannot be judged in terms of the values of other cultures. The cultural relativists, backed by Boas’s doctrines of scientific empiricism, virtually wiped out the credibility of the older Victorian evolutionists and gave to anthropology a shape it has had ever since.\n\ncultural relativism\n\n250\n\nVictorian culture, can say what is right and what is wrong, then how can we ever know what is right and what is wrong?” the answer was, “That’s easy. Intellectuals will tell you. Intellectuals, unlike members of studiable cultures, know what they’re talking and writing about, because what they say isn’t culturally relative. What they say is absolute. This is because intellectuals follow science, which is objective. An objective observer does not have relative opinions because he is nowhere within the world he observes.\n\nthis is so ironic. in comes postmodernism.. werent these the logical positivists?\n\n250\n\nBookmark\n\n250\n\nThese books were legitimate anthropological documents but they were also political tracts in the new shift from social to intellectual dominance, in which the reasoning ran: “If we have seen scientifically that they can have free sex in Samoa and it doesn’t seem to hurt anybody, then that proves we can have it here and not hurt anybody either. We have to use our intellect to discover what is right and wrong and not just blindly follow our own past customs.” The new cultural relativism became popular because it was a ferocious instrument for the dominance of intellect over society. Intellect could now pass judgment on all forms of social custom, including Victorian custom, but society could no longer pass judgment on intellect. That put intellect clearly in the driver’s seat.\n\n251\n\nVictorians believed all little children were born in sin and needed strict discipline to remove them from this condition. The twentieth-century intellectuals called that “rubbish.” There is no scientific evidence that little children are born in sin, they said. The whole idea of sin has no objective reality. Sin is simply a violation of a set of arbitrary social rules which little children can hardly be expected to be aware of, let alone obey. A far more objective explanation of “sin” is that a collection of social patterns, grown old and corrupt and decadent, tries to justify its own existence by proclaiming that all who fail to conform to it are evil rather than admit any evil of its own.  \nThere are two ways to get rid of this “sin,” said the intellectuals. One is to force all children to conform to the ancient rules without ever questioning whether these rules are right or wrong. The other is to study the social patterns that have led to this condemnation and see how they can be altered to allow the natural inclinations of an innocent child to fulfill his needs without this charge of sinfulness arising. If the child is behaving naturally, then it is the society that calls him sinful that needs correction. If children are shown kindness and affection and given freedom to think and explore for themselves, children can arrive rationally at what is best for themselves and for the world. Why should they want to go in any other direction?\n\nwhat is natural is good, except for when i dont agree with it. in that case its a naturalistic fallacy.\n\n251\n\nMetaphysics of Quality supports this dominance of intellect over society. It says intellect is a higher level of evolution than society; therefore, it is a more moral level than society. It is better for an idea to destroy a society than it is for a society to destroy an idea. But having said this, the Metaphysics of Quality goes on to say that science, the intellectual pattern that has been appointed to take over society, has a defect in it. The defect is that subject-object science has no provision for morals. Subject-object science is only concerned with facts. Morals have no objective reality. You can look through a microscope or telescope or oscilloscope for the rest of your life and you will never find a single moral. There aren’t any there. They are all in your head. They exist only in your imagination.  \nFrom the perspective of a subject-object science, the world is a completely purposeless, valueless place. There is no point in anything. Nothing is right and nothing is wrong. Everything just functions, like machinery. There is nothing morally wrong with being lazy, nothing morally wrong with lying, with theft, with suicide, with murder, with genocide. There is nothing morally wrong because there are no morals, just functions.  \nNow that intellect was in command of society for the first time in history, was this the intellectual pattern it was going to run society with?\n\nkey passage. he kinda comes full circle, returning to the objective science he ridiculed in the beginning.\n\n253\n\nThe moral values that were replacing the old European Victorian ones were the moral values of American Indians: kindness to children, maximum freedom, openness of speech, love of simplicity, affinity for nature.\n\ni like these\n\n253\n\nFreud.  \nThus, throughout this century we have seen over and over again that intellectuals weren’t blaming crime on man’s biological nature, but on the social patterns that had repressed this biological nature.\n\nreally makes me wonder how such a harmful situation came to be, or is that also just an opinion aka value pattern?\n\n254\n\ndetail. They depend on the ability to subordinate to authority, whether it is a cop or an office manager or a bus driver. An upbringing that allows the child to grow “naturally” in the Indian fashion does not necessarily guarantee the finest sort of urban adjustment.  \nIn the time that Phædrus grew up, intellect was dominant over society, but the results of the new social looseness weren’t turning out as predicted. Something was wrong. The world was no doubt in better shape intellectually and technologically but despite that, somehow, the “quality” of it was not good. There was no way you could say why this quality was no good. You just felt it.  \nSometimes you could see little fragments of reflections of what was wrong but they were just fragments and you couldn’t put them together. He remembered seeing The Glass Menagerie, by Tennessee Williams, in which one edge of the stage had an arrow-shaped neon sign flashing on and off, on and off, and beneath the arrow was the word, “PARADISE,” also flashing on and off. Paradise, it kept saying, is right where this arrow points:  \nPARADISE ￼ PARADISE ￼ PARADISE ￼  \n  \nBut the Paradise was always somewhere pointed to, always somewhere else. Paradise was never here. Paradise was always at the end of some intellectual, technological ride, but you knew that when you got there paradise wouldn’t be there either. You would just see another sign saying:  \nPARADISE ￼ PARADISE ￼ PARADISE ￼  \n  \nand pointing another direction to go.\n\nreminds me of quitting osrs bc \"theres always another hill\", also the rat race and \"carrot on a stick\". forever chasing, never finding.\n\n254\n\nmodels. Artists and writers of the thirties such as Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, James Farrell, Faulkner, Steinbeck and hundreds of others dug deep into the illiterate roots of white American culture to find the new morality, not understanding that it was this white illiterate American culture that was closest to the values of the Indian.\n\ni think ill like faulkner\n\n255\n\nOn a theater marquee, the title Rebel Without a Cause caught his attention in the same way. It pointed to the same low-quality thing that he saw everywhere but which couldn’t be put into words.  \nYou had to be a rebel without a cause. The intellectuals had preempted all the causes. Causes were to the twentieth-century intellectuals as manners had been to Victorians. There was no way you could beat a Victorian on manners and there was no way you could beat a twentieth-century intellectual on causes.\n\nthis reminds me of my own struggles with nihilism and existentialism and how i \"solved\" that by taking Kierkegaards leap of faith, ie choosing to believe that something matters. Curious to learn what solution he finds…\n\n256\n\nThey had lost some of their realness. They were living in some kind of movie projected by this intellectual, electromechanical machine that had been created for their happiness, saying:  \nPARADISE ￼ PARADISE ￼ PARADISE ￼  \n  \nbut which had inadvertently shut them out from direct experience of life itself—and from each other.\n\nmakes me think of the spectacle by debord and simulations and simulacra by someone else\n\n256\n\nanimal. He could invent moral goals for himself, but they are just artificial inventions. Scientifically speaking he has no goals.\n\nOOF\n\n262\n\n“I told you you’ll never find happiness this way, Lila,” her mother said. Her face had that little smile she always got when she made somebody feel bad.  \n“I’m tired of hearing that, mother,” Lila answered.\n\nwould be interesting if the whole lila story was a way of saying that complete abandonment of victorian social values leads to people returning to biological values aka sex which is also not fulfilling in the end.\n\n267\n\nAssail\n\n(v. t.) To attack with violence, or in a vehement and hostile manner; to assault; to molest; as, to assail a man with blows; to assail a city with artillery.  \n(v. t.) To encounter or meet purposely with the view of mastering, as an obstacle, difficulty, or the like.  \n(v. t.) To attack morally, or with a view to produce changes in the feelings, character, conduct, existing usages, institutions; to attack by words, hostile influence, etc.; as, to assail one with appeals, arguments, abuse, ridicule, and the like.\n\n267\n\nKingston. He thought Lila was immoral because she’d broken up a family and destroyed a man’s position in the social community—a biological pattern of quality and sex had destroyed a social pattern of quality, a family and a job. What made Rigel mad was that into this scene come intellectuals like Phædrus who say it’s unintelligent to repress biological drives. You must decide these matters on the basis of reason, not on the basis of social codes.\n\nin victorian times, social code were supposed to reign over biological codes, but intellectuals argue to leave social vaue ut of the dquation and decide biological value based on reason.\n\n267\n\nThe Metaphysics of Quality uproots the intellectual source of this confusion, the doctrine that says, “Science is not concerned with values. Science is concerned only with facts.”\n\nMOQ attempts to eradicate the confusion that intellectualism surpasses social values as it were, bc it is not concerned with them. instead, i think he will argue that science IS able to concern tself with social values, breaking the supposed simple social-intellectual struggle wide open, givin intellectual value the upper hand.\n\n267\n\nUproot\n\n(v. t.) To root up; to tear up by the roots, or as if by the roots; to remove utterly; to eradicate; to extirpate.\n\n267\n\nThe question of whether promiscuity is moral had been resolved from prehistoric times to the end of the Victorian era, but suddenly everything was upended by this new intellectual supremacy that said sexual promiscuity is neither moral nor immoral, it is just amoral human behavior.\n\nwell, the issue was that its always been seen as bad (for most of recorded history at least). but i guess at least there was an answer. now it was all in the open again\n\n267\n\nscience?” If he gets tricky and tries to say that that is a moral question about science which is not a part of science, then he has committed schizophrenia. He is admitting the existence of a real world that science cannot comprehend.\n\nwell no he wpuld simply accept tht there are question outside the realm of sciencd right? no scietit would say values are unimportant or that theyre ot \"real\"?\n\n268\n\nOnce this political battle is resolved, the Metaphysics of Quality can then go back and re-ask the question, “Just exactly how independent is science, in fact, from society?” The answer it gives is, “not at all.” A science in which social patterns are of no account is as unreal and absurd as a society in which biological patterns are of no account. It’s an impossibility.  \nIf society enters nowhere into the business of scientific discovery then where does a scientific hypothesis come from? If the observer is totally objective and records only what he observes, then where does he observe a hypothesis? Atoms don’t carry hypotheses about themselves around as part of their luggage. As long as you assume an exclusive subject-object, mind-matter science, that whole question is an inescapable intellectual black hole.\n\nthe formation of hypotheses is a social process\n\n268\n\nOur scientific description of nature is always culturally derived. Nature tells us only what our culture predisposes us to hear. The selection of which inorganic patterns to observe and which to ignore is made on the basis of social patterns of value, or when it is not, on the basis of biological patterns of value.\n\nthis selection DETERMINES our theoretical framework in large parts\n\n268\n\nchurch control argued that science is not concerned with morals. Intellectuals would leave morals for the church to decide. But what the larger intellectual structure of the Metaphysics of Quality makes clear is that this political battle of science to free itself from domination by social moral codes was in fact a moral battle! It was the battle of a higher, intellectual level of evolution to keep itself from being devoured by a lower, social level of evolution.\n\nhistorically sciences refusal to concern itself with \"values\" was a defence mechanism\n\n269\n\nThe Metaphysics of Quality resolves the relationship between intellect and society, subject and object, mind and matter, by embedding all of them in a larger system of understanding. Objects are inorganic and biological values; subjects are social and intellectual values.\n\nB\n\n269\n\nKnowledge has grown away from this historic purpose and become an end in itself just as society has grown away from its original purpose of preserving physical human beings and become an end in itself, and this growing away from original purposes toward greater Quality is a moral growth. But those original purposes are still there. And when things get lost and go adrift it is useful to remember that point of departure.\n\nhis language is so simple and elegant. i wnder f he is gonna int at ai. that would be stupedous\n\n269\n\nand improve their situation. The animals Dynamically invented societies, and societies Dynamically invented intellectual knowledge for the same reasons. Therefore, to the question, “What is the purpose of all this intellectual knowledge?” the Metaphysics of Quality answers, “The fundamental purpose of knowledge is to Dynamically improve and preserve society.”\n\n… or to invent something bigger… agi?\n\n269\n\nvalues. They are not two mysterious universes that go floating around in some subject-object dream that allows them no real contact with one another. They have a matter-of-fact evolutionary relationship. That evolutionary relationship is also a moral one.\n\nokau woul be great, but isnt this what entie philosophies base themselves on: proving the outside world exists or prpving the other exists? if you dont do that, this will remain a nice theory\n\n270\n\nEncroachment\n\n(n.) The act of entering gradually or silently upon the rights or possessions of another; unlawful intrusion.\n\n270\n\nThe Metaphysics of Quality says there are not just two codes of morals, there are actually five: inorganic-chaotic, biological-inorganic, social-biological, intellectual-social, and Dynamic-static. This last, the Dynamic-static code, says what’s good in life isn’t defined by society or intellect or biology. What’s good is freedom from domination by any static pattern, but that freedom doesn’t have to be obtained by the destruction of the patterns themselves.\n\n272\n\npeople began to see this, they dropped away from the movement, and the Hippie revolution, like the intellectual revolution of the twenties, became a moral rebellion that failed.  \nToday, it seemed to Phædrus, the overall picture is one of moral movements gone bankrupt. Just as the intellectual revolution undermined social patterns, the Hippies undermined both static and intellectual patterns. Nothing better has been introduced to replace them. The result has been a drop in both social and intellectual quality. In the United States the national intelligence level shown in SAT scores has gone down. Organized crime has grown more powerful and more sinister. Urban ghettos have grown larger and more dangerous. The end of the twentieth century in America seems to be an intellectual, social, and economic rust-belt, a whole society that has given up on Dynamic improvement and is slowly trying to slip back to Victorianism, the last static ratchet-latch. More Dynamic foreign cultures are overtaking it and actually invading it because it’s now incapable of competing. What’s coming out of the urban slums, where old Victorian social moral codes are almost completely destroyed, isn’t any new paradise the revolutionaries hoped for, but a reversion to rule by terror, violence and gang death—the old biological might-makes-right morality of prehistoric brigandage that primitive societies were set up to overcome.\n\nso at any given point in time, different types of values dominate parts of our world in parallel\n\n273\n\nThere had always been a battle here between intense legions of the most Dynamic and most moral on one side, confronting the most biological and least moral at the other; between A-class people and F-class people. The B’s and C’s were out in the other boroughs and suburbs, doing static things. But now, here, the F’s seemed to be winning.\n\nhow about people intending biological harm using intellectual patterns ie greedy rich people. is that priimarily biological ie lad by greed (mb social even), but how can u tell if they use intellect?\n\n273\n\nAttrition\n\n(n.) The act of rubbing together; friction; the act of wearing by friction, or by rubbing substances together; abrasion.  \n(n.) The state of being worn.  \n(n.) Grief for sin arising only from fear of punishment or feelings of shame. See Contrition.\n\n274\n\nThe most sinister thing about the fall of the Roman Empire was that the people who conquered it never understood that they had done so. They paralyzed the patterns of Roman social structure to a point where everybody just forgot what that structure was. Taxes became uncollectible. Armies composed of hired barbarians stopped receiving pay. Everything just lapsed. The patterns of civilization were forgotten, and a Dark Age settled in.\n\nB. makes me sant t read the decine and fall of the doman empire\n\n274\n\nMetaphysics of Quality could be a replacement for the paralyzing intellectual system that is allowing all this destruction to go unchecked. The paralysis of America is a paralysis of moral patterns. Morals can’t function normally because morals have been declared intellectually illegal by the subject-object metaphysics that dominates present social thought.\n\ntwo things  \n  \n1. moq ca replace intelect which mde subject bject view  \n2. subject object view is kinda becoming an annoying trope\n\n277\n\nWe must understand that when a society undermines intellectual freedom for its own purposes it is absolutely morally bad, but when it represses biological freedom for its own purposes it is absolutely morally good.\n\n278\n\nIntellectual patterns cannot directly control biological patterns. Only social patterns can control biological patterns, and the instrument of conversation between society and biology is not words. The instrument of conversation between society and biology has always been a policeman or a soldier and his gun. All the laws of history, all the arguments, all the Constitutions and the Bills of Rights and Declarations of Independence are nothing more than instructions to the military and police. If the military and police can’t or don’t follow these instructions properly they might as well have never been written.\n\n279\n\nBookmark\n\n285\n\nIt’s the lifeboat problem. If you get too involved with too many people with too many problems they drag you under. You don’t save them. They sink you.\n\n285\n\nOf course she’s unimportant. Of course she’s a waste of time. She’s causing an interruption of other more important purposes in life. No one admits it, but that’s really the reason the insane get locked up. They’re disgusting people you want to get rid of but can’t. It’s not just that they have absurd ideas that nobody else believes. What makes them “insane” is that they have these ideas and are a nuisance to somebody else.  \nThe only thing that’s illegitimate is the cover-up, the pretense that you’re trying to help them by getting rid of them.\n\nB. the mentally ill\n\n286\n\nhis book. You can’t film insanity.  \nMaybe if, during the show, the whole theatre collapsed and the audience found themselves among the stars with just space all around and no support, wondering what a stupid thing this is, sitting here among the stars watching this film that has nothing to do with them and then suddenly realizing that this film is the only reality there is and that they had better get interested in it because what they see and what they are is the same thing and once it stops they will stop too.…  \nThat’s it. Everything! Gone!!\n\n286\n\nfrightened of the insanity. She was frightened of them.  \nThat was the hardest thing to deal with during his own commitment. Not the insanity. That came naturally. The hardest thing to deal with was the righteousness of the sane.  \nWhen you’re in agreement with the sane they’re a great comfort and protection, but when you disagree with them it’s another matter. Then they’re dangerous. Then they’ll do anything. The sinister thing that struck the most fear in him was what they’d do in the name of kindness. The ones he cared about most and who cared about him most suddenly, all of them, turned against him the same way they had against Ellen. They kept saying, “There’s no way we can reach you. If only we could make you understand.”\n\nTHE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF THE SANE\n\n286\n\nHe saw that the sane always know they are good because their culture tells them so. Anyone who tells them otherwise is sick, paranoid, and needs further treatment. To avoid that accusation Phædrus had had to be very careful of what he said when he was in the hospital. He told the sane what they wanted to hear and kept his real thoughts to himself.\n\n287\n\nCatalepsis\n\n(n.) A sudden suspension of sensation and volition, the body and limbs preserving the position that may be given them, while the action of the heart and lungs continues.\n\n287\n\nHe remembered how it seemed to him that he hadn’t entered any cataleptic trance. He had fallen out of one. He was free of a static pattern of life he’d thought was unchangeable.\n\n289\n\nthrive in academic institutions because they are easy to teach. You just Xerox something some philosopher has said and make the students discuss it, make them memorize it, and then flunk them at the end of the quarter if they forget it. Actual painting, music composition and creative writing are almost impossible to teach and so barely get in the academic door. True philosophy doesn’t get in at all. Philosophologists often have an interest in creating philosophy but, as philosophologists, they subordinate it, much as a literary scholar might subordinate his own interest in creative writing. Unless they are exceptional they don’t consider the creation of philosophy their real line of work.\n\n289\n\nPhilosophology is to philosophy as musicology is to music, or as art history and art appreciation are to art, or as literary criticism is to creative writing. It’s a derivative, secondary field, a sometimes parasitic growth that likes to think it controls its host by analyzing and intellectualizing its host’s behavior.  \nLiterature people are sometimes puzzled by the hatred many creative writers have for them. Art historians can’t understand the venom either. He supposed the same was true with musicologists but he didn’t know enough about them. But philosophologists don’t have this problem at all because the philosophers who would normally condemn them are a null-class. They don’t exist. Philosophologists, calling themselves philsophers, are just about all there are.\n\nbc philosophy is abt thinking itself. thinkong abt thinking is still thinking\n\n290\n\npartly to avoid putting a philosophological cart before the philosophical horse. Philosophologists not only start by putting the cart first; they usually forget the horse entirely. They say first you should read what all the great philosophers of history have said and then you should decide what you want to say. The catch here is that by the time you’ve read what all the great philosophers of history have said you’ll be at least two hundred years old. A second catch is that these great philosophers are very persuasive people and if you read them innocently you may be carried away by what they say and never see what they missed.  \nPhædrus, in contrast, sometimes forgot the cart but was fascinated by the horse. He thought the best way to examine the contents of various philosophological carts is first to figure out what you believe and then to see what great philosophers agree with you. There will always be a few somewhere. These will be much more interesting to read since you can cheer what they say and boo their enemies, and when you see how their enemies attack them you can kibitz a little and take a real interest in whether they were right or wrong.\n\njust CHOOSE. you dpnt need a phd in philosophy to be allowed to think freely. this is sth i could use to shift my attotude towards reading. appreciate confirmation bias, it may be more of an intuition thing after all which is a very important asset . modern psychological biases negate our intuition in a way, but m sure there s actually a bias for when peopl think THEY wont fall prey to a specifi bias.\n\n290\n\nYou get all lands of fresh new ideas by contrasting what he’s saying with what you already believe.\n\nim happy that thi is what ive been doing and im keen on harvestin these notes in a bit.\n\n293\n\non—the Metaphysics of Quality provides a foundation for a new one: the philosophy of insanity. As long as you’re stuck with the old conventions, insanity is going to be a “misunderstanding of the object by the subject.” The object is real, the subject is mistaken. The only problem is how to change the subject’s mind back to a correct comprehension of objective reality.\n\n293\n\nPersons like James and Einstein, immersed in the spirit of philosophy, do not see things like squirrels circling trees as necessarily trivial because solving puzzles like that are what they’re in philosophy and science for. Real science and real philosophy are not guided by preconceptions of what subjects are important to consider.\n\nveey imprtant. reons me of philosophy class, of raoul and thomas\n\n294\n\nBut he saw that they were representatives of the culture and they were always required to deal with insanity as cultural representatives, and he got awfully tired of their interminable role-playing. They were always playing the role of priests saving heretics.\n\nthe cultural vantage point of a psychiatrist is th place from which he decides someone as sane or insane\n\n294\n\nYears later, after he was certified as “sane,” he read “objective” medical descriptions of what he had experienced, and he was shocked at how slanderous they were. They were like descriptions of a religious sect written by a different, hostile religious sect. The psychiatric treatment was not a search for truth but the promulgation of a dogma. Psychiatrists seemed to fear the taint of insanity much as inquisitors once feared succumbing to the devil. Psychiatrists were not allowed to practice psychiatry if they were insane. It was required that they literally did not know what they were talking about.\n\n294\n\nPneumonia is a biological pattern. It is scientifically verifiable. You can know about it by studying the pneumococcus bacillus under a microscope.  \nInsanity on the other hand is an intellectual pattern. It may have biological causes but it has no physical or biological reality. No scientific instrument can be produced in court to show who is insane and who is sane. There’s nothing about insanity that conforms to any scientific law of the universe. The scientific laws of the universe are invented by sanity. There’s no way by which sanity, using the instruments of its own creation, can measure that which is outside of itself and its creations. Insanity isn’t an “object” of observation. It’s an alteration of observation itself. There is no such thing as a “disease” of patterns of intellect. There’s only heresy. And that’s what insanity really is.\n\n295\n\nAsk, “If there were only one person in the world, is there any way he could be insane?” Insanity always exists in relation to others. It is a social and intellectual deviation, not a biological deviation. The only test for insanity in a court of law or anywhere else is conformity to a cultural status quo. That is why the psychiatric profession bears such a resemblance to the old priesthoods. Both use physical restraint and abuse as ways of enforcing the status quo.\n\n295\n\nYou have as much chance convincing a psychiatrist that the intellectual order he enforces is rotten as you have of convincing a cop that the social order he supports is rotten. If they ever believed you they’d have to quit their jobs.\n\n296\n\nIf they ask you how you’re feeling you can’t say, “Great!” That would be a symptom of delusion. But you can’t say, “Rotten!” either. They’ll believe it and increase the tranquilizer dosage. You have to say, “Well … I think I may be improving a little bit …” and do so with a little look of humility and pleading in your eyes. That brings the smiles.\n\n296\n\nIn his first book he had cast this isolated role-player as the narrator, a fellow who is likable because he is so recognizably normal, but who has trouble coping with his own life because he has destroyed his ability to deal honestly with it. It was this isolation that indirectly broke up his family and led to this present life.\n\nreflection on ZAM\n\n297\n\nthe insane, those whose characteristic reactions are denied validity in their society.\n\n297\n\ninsanity is culturally defined. It occurs in all cultures but each culture has different criteria for what constitutes it. Kluckhohn has referred to an old Sicilian, who spoke only a little English, who came to a San Francisco hospital to be treated for a minor physical ailment. The intern who examined him noted that he kept muttering that he was being witched by a certain woman, that this was the real reason for his suffering. The intern promptly sent him to the psychiatric ward where he was kept for several years. Yet in the Italian colony from which he came everybody of his age group believed in witchcraft. It was “normal” in the sense of standard. If someone from the intern’s own economic and educational group had complained of being persecuted by a witch, this would have been correctly interpreted as a sign of mental derangement.  \nMany others reported cultural correlations of the symptoms of insanity. M. K. Opler found that Irish schizophrenic patients had preoccupations with sin and guilt related to sex. Not Italians. Italians were given to hypochondriachial complaints and body preoccupations. There was more open rejection of authority among Italians. Clifford Geertz stated that the Balinese definition of a madman is someone who, like an American, smiles when there is nothing to smile at. In one journal Phædrus found a description of different psychoses which were specialized according to culture: the Chippewa-Cree suffered from windigo, a form of cannibalism; in Japan there was imu, a cursing following snake-bite; among Polar Eskimos it is pibloktog, a tearing off of clothes and running across the ice; and in Indonesia was the famous amok, a brooding depression which succeeds to a dangerous explosion of violence.\n\namong other things this highlights the need for BIOGRAPHY\n\n298\n\nNow, psychiatry can’t really deal with all of this because it is pinioned to a subject-object truth system which declares that one particular intellectual pattern is real and all others are illusions. Psychiatry is forced to take this position in contradiction to history, which shows over and over again that one era’s illusions become another era’s truths, and in contradiction to geography, which shows that one area’s truths are another area’s illusions. But a philosophy of insanity generated by a Metaphysics of Quality states that all these conflicting intellectual truths are just value patterns. One can vary from a particular common historical and geographical truth pattern without being crazy.  \nThe anthropologists established a second point: not only does insanity vary from culture to culture, but sanity itself also varies from culture to culture. They found that the “ability to see reality” is not only a difference between the sane and the insane, it is also a difference between different cultures of the sane. Each culture presumes its beliefs correspond to some sort of external reality, but a geography of religious beliefs shows that this external reality can be just about any damn thing. Even the facts that people observe to confirm the “truth” are dependent on the culture they live in.  \nCategories that are unessential to a given culture, Boas said, will, on the whole, not be found in its language. Categories that are culturally important will be found in detail.\n\n299\n\nThe great arc along which all the possible human behaviors are distributed is far too immense and too full of contradictions for any one culture to utilize even any considerable portion of it. Selection is the first requirement. Without selection no culture could even achieve intelligibility and the intentions it selects and makes its own are a much more important matter than the particular detail of technology or the marriage formality that it also selects in similar fashion.\n\n300\n\nAny language is more than an instrument of conveying ideas, more even than an instrument for working upon the feelings of others and for self-expression. Every language is also a means of categorizing experience. The events of the “real” world are never felt or reported as a machine would do it. There is a selection process and an interpretation in the very act of response. Some features of the external situation are highlighted, others are ignored or not fully discriminated.  \nEvery people has its own characteristic class in which individuals pigeonhole their experiences. The language says, as it were, “notice this,” “always consider this separate from that,” “such and such things always belong together.” Since persons are trained from infancy to respond in these ways they take such discriminations for granted as part of the inescapable stuff of life.\n\n300\n\nEdward Sapir said,  \nThe fact of the matter is that the “real world” is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group.… Forms and significances which seem obvious to an outsider will be denied outright by those who carry out the patterns; outlines and implications that are perfectly clear to these may be absent to the eye of the onlooker.\n\nspir whorf hypothesis\n\n302\n\nJust as the biological immune system will destroy a life-saving skin graft with the same vigor with which it fights pneumonia, so will a cultural immune system fight off a beneficial new kind of understanding like that of the brujo in Zuñi with the same kind of vigor it uses to destroy crime. It can’t distinguish between them.\n\nthe mind will fight ideas unlike those it aready knows like the ody fighting a skin graft, it cant tell the difference\n\n302\n\nBookmark\n\n302\n\nBookmark\n\n302\n\nDharmakāya light.\n\n302\n\nselective. When a new fact comes in that does not fit the pattern we don’t throw out the pattern. We throw out the fact. A contradictory fact has to keep hammering and hammering and hammering, sometimes for centuries, before maybe one or two people will see it. And then these one or two have to start hammering on others for a long time before they see it too.\n\n304\n\nThe Tibetan Book of the Dead. Aldous Huxley referred to\n\n305\n\nAuspicious\n\n(a.) Having omens or tokens of a favorable issue; giving promise of success, prosperity, or happiness; predicting good; as, an auspicious beginning.  \n(a.) Prosperous; fortunate; as, auspicious years.  \n(a.) Favoring; favorable; propitious; -applied to persons or things.\n\n319\n\nIf objects are the ultimate reality then there’s only one true intellectual construction of things: that which corresponds to the objective world. But if truth is defined as a high-quality set of intellectual value patterns, then insanity can be defined as just a low-quality set of intellectual value patterns, and you get a whole different picture of it.\n\n319\n\nHer second alternative, he thought, would be to cave in to whatever it was she was fighting, and learn to “adjust.” She’d probably go into some kind of cultural dependency, with recurring trips to a psychiatrist or some kind of “social counselor” for “therapy,” accept the cultural “reality” that her rebellion was no good, and live with it. In this way she’d continue to lead a “normal” life, continuing her problem, whatever it was, within conventional cultural limits.\n\ncultural dependencay, lol\n\n319\n\nWhen the culture asks, “Why doesn’t this person see things the way we do?” you can answer that he doesn’t see them because he doesn’t value them. He’s gone into illegal value patterns because the illegal patterns resolve value conflicts that the culture’s unable to handle. The causes of insanity may be all kinds of things, from chemical imbalances to social conflicts. But insanity has solved these conflicts with illegal patterns which appear to be of higher quality.\n\nkinda answers the why of insanity\n\n320\n\nBookmark\n\n320\n\nWhen you enter a movie theater you know that all you’re going to see is 24 shadows per second flashed on a screen to give an illusion of moving people and objects. Yet despite this knowledge you laugh when the 24 shadows per second tell jokes and cry when the shadows show actors faking death. You know they are an illusion yet you enter the illusion and become a part of it and while the illusion is taking place you are not aware that it is an illusion. This is hypnosis. It is trance. It’s also a form of temporary insanity. But it’s also a powerful force for cultural reinforcement and for this reason the culture promotes movies and censors them for its own benefit.  \nPhædrus thought that in the case of permanent insanity the exits to the theater have been blocked, usually because of the knowledge that the show outside is so much worse. The insane person is running a private unapproved film which he happens to like better than the current cultural one. If you want him to run the film everyone else is seeing, the solution would be to find ways to prove to him that it would be valuable to do so, Phædrus thought. Otherwise why should he get “better”? He already is better. It’s the patterns that constitute “betterness” that are at issue. From an internal point of view insanity isn’t the problem. Insanity is the solution.\n\n320\n\nIf seeing is believing then hypnosis and trance should be impossible. But since they do exist, what you have is an empirically observable case of empiricism being overthrown.\n\nthis has alwas bugged me about assessment off consciousness like the EMV score\n\n323\n\nbe. Lila then becomes a complex ecology of patterns moving toward Dynamic Quality. Lila individually, herself, is in an evolutionary battle against the static patterns of her own life.\n\nsuddenly the question can ppl change is even more evidently dumb (the Q ppl ask at birthdays)\n\n323\n\nWhat he thought was, that in addition to the usual solutions to insanity—stay locked up or learn to conform—there was a third one, to reject all movies, private and cultural, and head for Dynamic Quality itself, which is no movie at all.\n\n323\n\nBut the Dynamic freedom they’re fighting for is a kind of morality too. And it’s a highly important part of the overall moral process. It’s often confused with degeneracy but it’s actually a form of moral regeneration. Without its continual refreshment static patterns would simply die of old age.\n\nso, wo dynamic value, static patterns would not improve, ie quality would not improve, and its the opposite of degeneracy\n\n324\n\nIf you eliminate suffering from this world you eliminate life. There’s no evolution. Those species that don’t suffer don’t survive. Suffering is the negative face of the Quality that drives the whole process. All these battles between patterns of evolution go on within suffering individuals like Lila.\n\n325\n\nHe heard Lila stirring once or twice. Once she got up and used the head. She wasn’t that catatonic. This quietness and boredom of a boat at anchor was the best cure in the world for catatonia.\n\n326\n\nThis was appropriate. If you don’t generalize you don’t philosophize.\n\n327\n\nJames said, “Truth is one species of good, and not, as is usually supposed, a category distinct from good, and coordinate with it.” He said, “The true is the name of whatever proves itself to be good in the way of belief.”  \n“Truth is a species of good.” That was right on. That was exactly what is meant by the Metaphysics of Quality. Truth is a static intellectual pattern within a larger entity called Quality.\n\n328\n\nJames had condensed this description to a single sentence: “There must always be a discrepancy between concepts and reality, because the former are static and discontinuous while the latter is dynamic and flowing.” Here James had chosen exactly the same words Phædrus had used for the basic subdivision of the Metaphysics of Quality.\n\nAnkiable. words describ the way the analytic knife cut\n\n328\n\nThe Metaphysics of Quality says pure experience is value. Experience which is not valued is not experienced. The two are the same. This is where value fits. Value is not at the tail-end of a series of superficial scientific deductions that puts it somewhere in a mysterious undetermined location in the cortex of the brain. Value is at the very front of the empirical procession.\n\n328\n\nBookmark\n\n329\n\nrack. The Metaphysics of Quality says that science’s empirical rejection of biological and social values is not only rationally correct, it is also morally correct because the intellectual patterns of science are of a higher evolutionary order than the old biological and social patterns.\n\ni ver uch conten this division of science being in the intellectual realm. it is as much social as it is intellectual. also i wonder if subject is social and intellectual, and object is organic and inorganic, then how is MOQ not just dualism with one more subdivision?\n\n329\n\nPhædrus supposed he could read on into all this James material but he doubted that he would find anything different from what he had already found. There is a time for investigation and there is a time for conclusion and he had a feeling that that latter time had come.\n\n332\n\nThey want to superimpose their movie on you.

What they wouldn’t see is that she is adjusting. That’s what the insanity is. She’s adjusting to something. The insanity is the adjustment. Insanity isn’t necessarily a step in the wrong direction, it can be an intermediate step in a right direction. It wasn’t necessarily a disease. It could be part of a cure.\n\nprobably pretty similar to rd langs vision. i wonder whether there are any other ideas of models fo psycosis just like they thought psychedelics were back in the day\n\n333\n\nShe has her own reality which no other culture is able to see. That’s what had to be reconciled.\n\n333\n\nBookmark\n\n335\n\nBoth lunatics and mystics have freed themselves from the conventional static intellectual patterns of their culture. The only difference is that the lunatic has shifted over to a private static pattern of his own, whereas the mystic has abandoned all static patterns in favor of pure Dynamic Quality.\n\ni guess mysticism here means acknowledging that reality should not be defined bc language is fallible\n\n337\n\naccidentally occurs in an insane asylum but occurs deliberately in a mystic retreat is a natural human process called dhyāna in Sanskrit. In our culture dhyāna is ambiguously called “meditation.” Just as mystics traditionally seek monasteries and ashrams and hermitages as retreats into isolation and silence, so are the insane treated by isolation in places of relative calm and austerity and silence. Sometimes, as a result of this monastic retreat into silence and isolation the patient arrives at a state Karl Menninger has described as “better than cured.” He is actually in better condition than he was before the insanity started. Phædrus guessed that in many of these “accidental” cases, the patient had learned by himself not to cling to any static patterns of ideas—cultural, private or any other.  \nIn the insane asylum this dhyāna is underrated and often undermined because there is no metaphysical basis for understanding it scientifically. But among religious mystics, particularly Oriental mystics, dhyāna has been one of the most intensely studied practices of all.  \nThis Western treatment of dhyāna is a beautiful example of how the static patterns of a culture can make something not exist, even when it does exist. People in this culture are hypnotized into thinking they do not meditate when in fact they do.  \nDhyāna was what this boat was all about. It’s what Phædrus had bought it for, a place to be alone and quiet and inconspicuous and able to settle down into himself and be what he really was and not what he was thought to be or supposed to be. In doing this he didn’t think he was putting this boat to any special purpose. That’s what the purpose of boats like this has always been … and seaside cottages too … and lake cabins … and hiking trails … and golf courses.… It’s the need for dhyāna that is behind all these.  \nVacations too … how perfectly named that is … a vacation, an emptying out … that’s what dhyāna is, an emptying out of all the static clutter and junk of one’s life and just settling into an undefined sort of tranquillity.\n\nDJHANA\n\n339\n\n“Nothing disturbs a bishop quite so much as the presence of a saint in the parish.” It was one of Phædrus’s favorites. The saint’s Dynamic understanding makes him unpredictable and uncontrollable, but the bishop’s got a whole calendar of static ceremonies to attend to; fund-raising projects to push forward, bills to pay, parishioners to meet. That saint’s going to up-end everything if he isn’t handled diplomatically. And even then he may do something wildly unpredictable that upsets everybody. What a quandary!\n\n345\n\nBookmark\n\n347\n\nFor example, you would guess from the literature on Zen and its insistence on discovering the “unwritten dharma” that it would be intensely anti-ritualistic, since ritual is the “written dharma.” But that isn’t the case. The Zen monk’s daily life is nothing but one ritual after another, hour after hour, day after day, all his life. They don’t tell him to shatter those static patterns to discover the unwritten dharma. They want him to get those patterns perfect!  \nThe explanation for this contradiction is the belief that you do not free yourself from static patterns by fighting them with other contrary static patterns. That is sometimes called “bad karma chasing its tail.” You free yourself from static patterns by putting them to sleep. That is, you master them with such proficiency that they become an unconscious part of your nature. You get so used to them you completely forget them and they are gone. There in the center of the most monotonous boredom of static ritualistic patterns the Dynamic freedom is found.\n\n348\n\nIt would be sort of theatrical and fake, he supposed, but that’s what funerals were: theatre. They weren’t for the corpse, certainly, but to help end the longings and old patterns of the living, who had to go on.\n\n348\n\nHe could only guess how far back this ritual-cosmos relationship went, maybe fifty or one hundred thousand years. Cavemen are usually depicted as hairy, stupid creatures who don’t do much, but anthropological studies of contemporary primitive tribes suggest that stone age people were probably bound by ritual all day long. There’s a ritual for washing, for putting up a house, for hunting, for eating and so on—so much so that the division between “ritual” and “knowledge” becomes indistinct. In cultures without books ritual seems to be a public library for teaching the young and preserving common values and information.  \nThese rituals may be the connecting link between the social and intellectual levels of evolution. One can imagine primitive song-rituals and dance-rituals associated with certain cosmology stories, myths, which generated the first primitive religions. From these the first intellectual truths could have been derived. If ritual always comes first and intellectual principles always come later, then ritual cannot always be a decadent corruption of intellect. Their sequence in history suggests that principles emerge from ritual, not the other way around. That is, we don’t perform religious rituals because we believe in God. We believe in God because we perform religious rituals. If so, that’s an important principle in itself.\n\nrituals and mythos\n\n348\n\nAmalgamate\n\n(v. t.)

It attempts to capture the Dynamic within a static pattern. But it never does. You never get it right. So why try?  \nIt’s like trying to construct a perfect unassailable chess game. No matter how smart you are you’re never going to play a game that is “right” for all people at all times, everywhere. Answers to ten questions led to a hundred more and answers to those led to a thousand more. Not only would he never get it right; the longer he worked on it the wronger it would probably get.\n\n366\n\nthen looked down at the road. Then the corners of her eyes crinkled and as they walked on Phædrus noticed she was sort of smiling and chuckling to herself.  \nLater, when John had left, she asked Dusenberry, “What did he mean when he said, ‘That’s a good dog.’ Was that just ‘Indian talk’?”  \nDusenberry thought for a while and said he supposed it was. Phædrus didn’t have any answer either, but for some reason he had been as amused and puzzled as LaVerne was.  \nA few months later she was killed in an airplane crash, and a few years after that Dusenberry was gone too and Phædrus’s own hospitalization and recovery had clouded over all memory of that time and he’d forgotten all about it, but now suddenly, out of nowhere, here it was again.  \nFor some time now he’d been thinking that if he were looking for proof that “substance” is a cultural heritage from Ancient Greece rather than an absolute reality, he should simply look at non-Greek-derived cultures. If the “reality” of substance was missing from those cultures that would prove he was right.  \nNow the image of the raggedy Indian dog was back, and he realized what it meant.  \nLaVerne had been asking the question within an Aristotelian framework. She wanted to know what genetic, substantive pigeonhole of canine classification this object walking before them could be placed in. But John Wooden Leg never understood the question. That’s what made it so funny. He wasn’t joking when he said, “That’s a good dog.” He probably thought she was worried the dog might bite her. The whole idea of a dog as a member of a hierarchical structure of intellectual categories known generically as “objects” was outside his traditional cultural viewpoint.  \nWhat was significant, Phædrus realized, was that John had distinguished the dog according to its Quality, rather than according to its substance.\n\n368\n\ninterpretations.  \nGood is a noun. That was it. That was what Phædrus had been looking for. That was the homer, over the fence, that ended the ball game. Good as a noun rather than as an adjective is all the Metaphysics of Quality is about. Of course, the ultimate Quality isn’t a noun or an adjective or anything else definable, but if you had to reduce the whole Metaphysics of Quality to a single sentence, that would be it.",

    "excerpt": "Farmacokinetiek en dynamiek\nDe **farmacodynamiek** beschrijft zowel de gewenste als ongewenste receptoreffecten van een farmacon.",
    "content": "## Farmacokinetiek en dynamiek\nDe **farmacodynamiek** beschrijft zowel de gewenste als ongewenste receptoreffecten van een farmacon. \n\nVoor de acute psychiatrie zijn de volgende **farmacokinetische** parameters van belang:\n- maximale plasmaconcentratie (Cmax);\n- tijd tot maximaal effect (Tmax);\n- eliminatiehalfwaardetijd (T1/2el);\n- steady-stateconcentratie (CSS).\n\n![[Pasted image 20250413135205.png]]\n- De marge tussen de gewenste en de ongewenste effecten van een geneesmiddel staat bekend als het ‘therapeutisch venster’ (= therapeutic window). \n- Sommige geneesmiddelen zoals lorazepam worden na intramusculaire toediening zodanig snel geabsorbeerd dat er nauwelijks verschil bestaat met intraveneuze toediening.\n- De eliminatiehalfwaardetijd is omgekeerd evenredig aan de klaring, zodat geneesmiddelen die relatief traag door het lichaam geklaard worden, een lange eliminatiehalfwaardetijd hebben.\n\n![[Pasted image 20250413135501.png]]\nIn het algemeen bereiken geneesmiddelen een stabiele plasmaconcentratie na vier à vijfmaal de eliminatiehalfwaardetijd (T1/2el) bij herhaalde gelijke doseringen. Het duurt dus relatief langer voor geneesmiddelen met een lange eliminatiehalfwaardetijd om een stabiele plasmaspiegel bereiken.\n## Farmacologische interventies\n- Haloperidol intramusculair zou altijd moeten worden gecombineerd met promethazine intramusculair. Dit omdat het i) niet klontert in dezelfde spuit en ii) promethazineadditie beschermend zou kunnen werken voor acute dystonie. \n- Bij aanwijzingen voor cardiovasculaire aandoeningen of een verlengde QTc-tijd, of bij ontbreken van een ecg, wordt de combinatie haloperidol-promethazine afgeraden en lorazepam alleen aanbevolen.\n- In alle gevallen moeten patiënten nauwkeurig elk halfuur worden gemonitord op extrapiramidale en autonome bijwerkingen, bloeddruk en hartslag, ademhalingsfrequentie, temperatuur, uitdrogingsverschijnselen en bewustzijn.\n- Bij middelenmisbruik geen antipsychotica in de acute fase (ook niet bij hallucinogenen!); wel benzodiazepinen. \n- Bij milde agitatie o.b.v. psychotische stoornis; lorazepam 1-2,5 mg po, haloperidol 2,5-5 mg po, olanzapine 10 mg po, of risperidon 2 mg po. \n- Bij ernstige agitatie o.b.v. psychotische stoornis; haloperidol-promethazine 5-50. \n- Mocht een acute dystonie desondanks optreden dan beveelt men aan om het anticholinergicum biperideen te gebruiken, 5 mg p.o. of i.m.\n- Midazolam intranasaal heeft het voordeel dat absorptie sneller plaatsvindt dan oraal en het net zo snel als midazolam intraveneus werkzaam is. \n- Het risico op ademhalingsproblemen is in de acute setting niet bekend, wat de toepassing van intranasaal midazolam in de acute setting verhindert.\n\nSamenvattend:\n- _Sedativa_:\n    - lorazepam is effectief bij acute opwindingstoestanden;\n    - lorazepam lijkt minder effectief dan de combinatie haloperidol-promethazine terwijl de combinatie lorazepam-haloperidol niet effectiever is en vaker wordt geassocieerd met bijwerkingen;\n    - lorazepam heeft de voorkeur bij een vermoeden van een somatische oorzaak of een middelenintoxicatie (in het bijzonder stimulantia en hallucinogenen);\n    - promethazine heeft relatief sterke anticholinerge effecten, waardoor het relatief gecontra-indiceerd is bij (oudere) delirante patiënten.\n- _Haloperidol_:\n    - zowel orale als intramusculaire toedieningen zijn effectief bij acute opwindingstoestanden.\n    - intramusculaire toediening wordt relatief vaak geassocieerd met acute dystonie.\n    - haloperidol gecombineerd met promethazine heeft een lagere incidentie van acute dystonie maar kan leiden tot verlenging van het QTc-interval.\n- _Tweedegeneratieantipsychotica_:\n    - het gebruik en de veiligheid van tweedegeneratieantipsychotica voor acute sedatie worden beperkt ondersteund;\n    - olanzapine lijkt even effectief als haloperidol, maar heeft mogelijk een kortere werkingsduur.\n\nAndere middelen:\n- Levomepromazine (= Nozinan) heeft een receptorprofiel dat vergelijkbaar is met zowel promethazine als het oude antipsychoticum chloorpromazine. Het heeft een ongunstig farmacokinetisch profiel als middel voor de acute situatie in verband met de lange eliminatiehalfwaardetijd (T1/2el 15-78 uur).\n\nBijwerkingen veroorzaakt door antidopaminerge, antiadrenerge, anticholinerge en antihistaminerge effecten van antipsychotica\n- Dopamine 2 (D,)-receptorantagonisme (antidopaminerg): extrapiramidale symptomen, hyperprolactiniemie\n- Alfa 1(a,)-receptorantagonisme (antiadrenerg): sedatie, (orthostatische) hypotensie, duizeligheid\n- Muscarine 1 (M,)-receptorantagonisme (anticholinerg): droge mond, obstipatie, urineretentie, visusstoornissen, geheugenproblemen, delier\n- Histamine 1-(H,)-receptorantagonisme (antihistaminerg): sedatie, gewichtstoename\n\nBenzodiazepinen:\n- De effecten van de benzodiazepinen zijn dosisafhankelijk, waarbij bij oplopende doseringen respectievelijk optreden: anxiolyse, spierrelaxatie, amnesie, overmatige sedatie, coma en ademhalingsonderdrukking. -- Benzodiazepinen hebben een breed therapeutisch venster omdat ademhalingsonderdrukking altijd wordt voorafgegaan door (over)sedatie\n- Clorazepinezuur en diazepam hebben de langste T1/2.\n- Clorazepinezuur is een zogenoemde ‘prodrug’: het is op zichzelf farmacologisch inactief. Het brengt een risico op accumulatie en oversedatie bij herhaalde toediening met zich mee.  \n\n## Geneesmiddeleninteracties\n- Geneesmiddeleninteracties kunnen zowel farmacodynamisch als farmacokinetisch van aard zijn. Farmacodynamische interacties zijn het gevolg van versterking of vermindering van het effect van een geneesmiddel door een ander geneesmiddel op receptorniveau. Wanneer geneesmiddelenconcentraties in het bloed en/of de hersenen stijgen of dalen door een ander geneesmiddel, is er sprake van een ‘farmacokinetische interactie’.\n- De combinatie olanzapine met benzodiazepinen wordt specifiek geassocieerd met oversedatie en zuurstofdesaturatie. Hoewel de data beperkt zijn, lijkt dit met name relevant wanneer olanzapine i.m. wordt toegediend of wanneer er sprake is van een comorbide alcoholintoxicatie.\n- Voor psychofarmaca zijn CYP2D6 en CYP3A4 het meest van belang. Een psychofarmacon dat door een bepaald CYP-enzym wordt gemetaboliseerd, staat bekend als een substraat voor dat specifieke enzym. CYP2D6 is voor zover bekend niet induceerbaar. \n- Wanneer een geneesmiddel de CYP-enzymactiviteit verhoogt (inductie) of verlaagt (inhibitie), kan er respectievelijk een verlaagde of verhoogde plasmaspiegel van het betrokken substraat ontstaan\n\n![[Pasted image 20250413142035.png]]\n\n- In het algemeen zijn antipsychotica vatbaar voor CYP2D6-inhibitie en CYP3A4-inductie, terwijl zowel CYP3A4-inductie als -remming relevant is voor benzodiazepinen.\n\n## Relevante somatische bijwerkingen\n- $QT_c$-interval verlenging\n- Acute EPS\n\t- Acute dystonieën zijn de ernstigste verschijningsvorm hiervan; ze kunnen zich uiten in bijvoorbeeld oculogyrische crisis, torticollis, opistotonus, laryngospasme en slikstoornissen. Specifiek in geval van laryngospasme kan vroege herkenning levensreddend zijn. De behandeling bestaat uit **biperideen 2 mg intramusculair of intraveneus**, wat in meeste gevallen binnen enkele minuten tot effect zal leiden.\n- Delier\n\t- Olanzapine heeft anticholinerge die een delier kunnen uitlokken of verergeren bij ouderen, vooral in combinatie met andere middelen met sterke anticholinerge effecten (zoals promethazine).\n- Epileptische insulten zijn beschreven bij antipsychoticagebruik. Dit fenomeen is dosisafhankelijk en waarschijnlijk alleen relevant voor patiënten met comorbide epilepsie.\n- Paradoxale effecten (vijandigheid, agressie, opwindingstoestanden, prikkelbaarheid, impulsief gedrag) ten gevolge van benzodiazepinen zijn controversieel: er is beperkt systematisch onderzoek hiernaar verricht, de incidentie is vergelijkbaar met placebo (< 1%) en wellicht alleen relevant bij patiënten met persoonlijkheidspathologie, premorbide agressief gedrag, zwakbegaafdheid en middelenafhankelijkheid.",

There was neither time nor desire to consider moral or ethical issues. Every man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family waiting for him at home, and to save his friends. With no hesitation, therefore, he would arrange for another prisoner, another “number,” to take his place in the transport. (page 14)  \n\n> On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves. We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles—whatever one may choose to call them—we know: the best of us did not return. (page 14)  \n\n> When one examines the vast amount of material which has been amassed as the result of many prisoners’ observations and experiences, three phases of the inmate’s mental reactions to camp life become apparent: the period following his admission; the period when he is well entrenched in camp routine; and the period following his release and liberation. (page 16)  \n\n> The symptom that characterizes the first phase is shock. (page 16)  \n\n> initial silence was interrupted by shouted commands. We were to hear those rough, shrill tones from then on, over and over again in all the camps. Their sound was almost like the last cry of a victim, and yet there was a difference. It had a rasping hoarseness, as if it came from the throat of a man who had to keep shouting like that, a man who was being murdered again and again. The carriage doors were flung open and a small detachment of prisoners stormed inside. They wore striped uniforms, their heads were shaved, but they looked well fed. They spoke in every possible European tongue, and all with a certain amount of humor, which sounded grotesque under the circumstances. Like a drowning man clutching a straw, my inborn optimism (which has often controlled my feelings even in the most desperate situations) clung to this thought: These prisoners look quite well, they seem to be in good spirits and even laugh. Who knows? I might manage to share their favorable position. (page 17)  \n\n> Apart from the already described reactions, the newly arrived prisoner experienced the tortures of other most painful emotions, all of which he tried to deaden.

If, as usually happened, some of the excrement splashed into his face during its transport over bumpy fields, any sign of disgust by the prisoner or any attempt to wipe off the filth would only be punished with a blow from a Capo. And thus the mortification of normal reactions was hastened. (page 24)  \n\n> Apathy, the blunting of the emotions and the feeling that one could not care any more, were the symptoms arising during the second stage of the prisoner’s psychological reac- tions, and which eventually made him insensitive to daily and hourly beatings. By means of this insensibility the prisoner soon surrounded himself with a very necessary protective shell. (page 26)  \n\n> Apathy, the main symptom of the second phase, was a necessary mechanism of self-defense. Reality dimmed, and all efforts and all emotions were centered on one task: preserving one’s own life and that of the other fellow. (page 29)  \n\n> “vae victis”—woe to the vanquished.

If a certain quantity of gas is pumped into an empty chamber, it will fill the chamber completely and evenly, no matter how big the chamber. Thus suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the “size” of human suffering is absolutely relative.

Therefore, I was responsible to the camp authority for keeping the hut clean—if “clean” can be used to describe such a condition. The pretense at inspection to which the hut was frequently submitted was more for the purpose of torture than of hygiene. More food and a few drugs would have helped, but the only concern of the inspectors was whether a piece of straw was left in the center corridor, or whether the dirty, ragged and verminous blankets of the patients were tucked in neatly at their feet.

(page 53)  \n\n> Dostoevski said once, “There is only one thing that I dread: not to be worthy of my sufferings.” These words frequently came to my mind after I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering and death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost. It can be said that they were worthy of their sufferings; the way they bore their suffering was a genuine inner achievement. It is this spiritual freedom—which cannot be taken away—that makes life meaningful and purposeful. (page 54)  \n\n> man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces. (page 54)\n- There can be meaning in suffering .... \n\n> It is true that only a few peo- ple are capable of reaching such high moral standards. Of the prisoners only a few kept their full inner liberty and obtained those values which their suffering afforded, but even one such example is suffcient proof that man’s inner strength may raise him above his outward fate.  (page 55)  \n\n> The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even under the most diffcult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life. It may remain brave, dignified and unselfish. Or in the bitter fight for self-preservation he may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a diffcult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not. (page 55)  \n\n> A well-known research psychologist has pointed out that life in a concentration camp could be called a “provisional existence.” We can add to this by defining it as a “provisional existence of unknown limit. (page 56)  \n\n> A man who could not see the end of his “provisional existence” was not able to aim at an ultimate goal in life. He ceased living for the future, in contrast to a man in normal life. Therefore the whole structure of his inner life changed; signs of decay set in which we know from other areas of life. The unemployed worker, for example, is in a similar position. His existence has become provisional and in a certain sense he cannot live for the future or aim at a goal. Research work done on unemployed miners has shown that they suffer from a peculiar sort of deformed time—inner time—which is a result of their unemployed state. Prisoners, too, suffered from this strange “time-experience.” In camp, a small time unit, a day, for example, filled with hourly tortures and fatigue, appeared endless. A larger time unit, perhaps a week, seemed to pass very quickly. (page 57)  \n\n> —without a future and without a goal. (page 57)\n- psychisch lijden al een donkere wolk zonder einde en zonder je een andere toekomst voor te kunnen stellen \n\n> He regarded it as over and done, as if he had already died. (page 57)  \n\n> A man who let himself decline because he could not see any future goal found himself occupied with retrospective thoughts. In a different connection, we have already spoken of the tendency there was to look into the past, to help make the present, with all its horrors, less real. But in robbing the present of its reality there lay a certain danger. It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. (page 57)\n- robbing the present of its reality makes you overlook opportunities for the future \n\n> Instead of taking the camp’s diffculties as a test of their inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. (page 58)\n- life is testing you ad allowing you to show spiritual growth \n\n> Any attempt at fighting the camp’s psychopathological influence on the prisoner by psychotherapeutic or psychohygienic methods had to aim at giving him inner strength by pointing out to him a future goal to which he could look forward. (page 58)\n- show people there is a future \n\n> It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub specie aeternitatis.  (page 58)  \n\n> What does Spinoza say in his Ethics? —“Affectus, qui passio est, desinit esse passio simulatque eius claram et distinctam formamus ideam.” Emotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it. (page 59)  \n\n> The prisoner who had lost faith in the future—his future—was doomed. With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay. Usually this happened quite suddenly, in the form of a crisis, the symptoms of which were familiar to the experienced camp inmate. We all feared this moment—not for ourselves, which would have been pointless, but for our friends. Usually it began with the prisoner refusing one morning to get dressed and wash or to go out on the parade grounds. No entreaties, no blows, no threats had any effect. He just lay there, hardly moving. If this crisis was brought about by an illness, he refused to be taken to the sick-bay or to do anything to help himself. He simply gave up. There he remained, lying in his own excreta, and nothing bothered him any more. (page 59)  \n\n> As we said before, any attempt to restore a man’s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal. Nietzsche’s words, “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,” could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners. (page 60)  \n\n> us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. (page 61)  \n\n> His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden. (page 62)  \n\n> Rilke spoke of “getting through suffering” as others would talk of “getting through work. (page 62)\n- \"je moet door het lijden heen\" \n\n> I remember two cases of would-be suicide, which bore a striking similarity to each other. Both men had talked of their intentions to commit suicide. Both used the typical argument —they had nothing more to expect from life. In both cases it was a question of getting them to realize that life was still expecting something from them; something in the future was expected of them. We found, in fact, that for the one it was his child whom he adored and who was waiting for him in a foreign country. For the other it was a thing, not a person. This man was a scientist and had written a series of books which still needed to be finished.

Certainly, it was a considerable achievement for a guard or foreman to be kind to the prisoners in spite of all the camp’s influences, and, on the other hand, the baseness of a prisoner who treated his own companions badly was exceptionally contemptible. Obviously the prisoners found the lack of character in such men especially upsetting, while they were profoundly moved by the smallest kindness received from any of the guards. I remember how one day a foreman secretly gave me a piece of bread which I knew he must have saved from his breakfast ration. It was far more than the small piece of bread which moved me to tears at that time. It was the human “something” which this man also gave to me—the word and look which accompanied the gift. (page 67)  \n\n> We had literally lost the ability to feel pleased and had to relearn it slowly. (page 68)\n- after liberation \n\n> Just as the physical health of the caisson worker would be endangered if he left his diver’s chamber suddenly (where he is under enormous atmospheric pressure), so the man who has suddenly been liberated from mental pressure can suffer damage to his moral and spiritual health. (page 69)  \n\n> During this psychological phase one observed that people with natures of a more primitive kind could not escape the influences of the brutality which had surrounded them in camp life. Now, being free, they thought they could use their freedom licentiously and ruthlessly. The only thing that had changed for them was that they were now the oppressors instead of the oppressed. They became instigators, not objects, of willful force and injustice. They justified their behavior by their own terrible experiences. (page 69)\n- trauma response, may be the cause or mechanism of antisocial or anger issues \n\n> Apart from the moral deformity resulting from the sudden release of mental pressure, there were two other fundamental experiences which threatened to damage the character of the liberated prisoner: bitterness and disillusionment when he returned to his former life. (page 70)  \n\n> According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. (page 74)  \n\n> Of course, there may be some cases in which an individual’s concern with values is really a camouflage of hidden inner conflicts; but, if so, they represent the exceptions from the rule rather than the rule itself. In these cases we have actually to deal with pseudovalues, and as such they have to be unmasked. Unmasking, however, should stop as soon as one is confronted with what is authentic and genuine in man, e.g., man’s desire for a life that is as meaningful as possible. If it does not stop then, the only thing that the “unmasking psychologist” really unmasks is his own “hidden motive”—namely, his unconscious need to debase and depreciate what is genuine, what is genuinely human, in man. (page 75)  \n\n> The term “existential” may be used in three ways: to refer to (1) existence itself, i.e., the specifically human mode of being; (2) the meaning of existence; and (3) the striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning. (page 75)\n- Good definition of existential. Also, when phrased this way, there appear to be similarities between logotherapy and existential therapy as devised by Yalom. I wonder whether he was inspired by Frankl. \n\n> Noögenic neuroses do not emerge from conflicts between drives and instincts but rather from existential problems. (page 75)\n- that means ordinry neuroses, in the psychoanalytic sense, do appear from conflicts between drives and instincts? \n\n> A man’s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. It may well be that interpreting the first in terms of the latter motivates a doctor to bury his patient’s existential despair under a heap of tranquilizing drugs. It is his task, rather, to pilot the patient through his existential crises of growth and development. (page 76)  \n\n> Logotherapy deviates from psychoanalysis insofar as it considers man a being whose main concern consists in fulfilling a meaning, rather than in the mere gratification and satisfaction of drives and instincts, or in merely reconciling the conflicting claims of id, ego and superego, or in the mere adaptation and adjustment to society and environment. (page 77)  \n\n> There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” (page 77)  \n\n> I consider it a dangerous misconception of mental hygiene to assume that what man needs in the first place is equilibrium or, as it is called in biology, “homeostasis,” i.e., a tensionless state. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. (page 78)\n- Not a fan of homeostasis \n\n> No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism) (page 78)  \n\n> I doubt whether a doctor can answer this question in general terms. For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment. To put the question in general terms would be comparable to the question posed to a chess champion: “Tell me, Master, what is the best move in the world?” (page 80)  \n\n> Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. (page 80)\n- it's like life asks you what the meaning of YOUR life is going to be. it's up to you. \n\n> That is why a logotherapist is the least tempted of all psychotherapists to impose value judgments on his patients, for he will never permit the patient to pass to the doctor the responsibility of judging. (page 81)\n- very similar to how we point people at their own responsibility nowadays. \n\n> By declaring that man is responsible and must actualize the potential meaning of his life, I wish to stress that the true meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man or his own psyche, as though it were a closed system. (page 81)  \n\n> It denotes the fact that being human always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself. What is called self-actualization is not an attainable aim at all, for the simple reason that the more one would strive for it, the more he would miss it. In other words, self-actualization is possible only as a side-effect of self- transcendence. (page 81)  \n\n> According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three dif- ferent ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. The first, the way of achievement or accomplishment, is quite obvious. The second and third need further elaboration. (page 81)  \n\n> It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. That is why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has a meaning. (page 83)\n- but wat if suffering has no meaning, or is he saying that it alwas does? \n\n> More and more, a psychiatrist is approached today by patients who confront him with human problems rather than neurotic symptoms. Some of the people who nowadays call on a psychiatrist would have seen a pastor, priest or rabbi in former days. Now they often refuse to be handed over to a clergyman and instead confront the doctor with questions such as, “What is the meaning of my life?” (page 84)\n- Already in 1946... \n\n> I observed that procreation is not the only meaning of life, for then life in itself would become meaningless, and something which in itself is meaningless cannot be rendered meaningful merely by its perpetuation. (page 86)\n- say hi to evolution \n\n> “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. (page 88)\n- when looking at a young person \n\n> tranquilized away by its psychodynamic interpretation; on the other hand, a neurotic fear, such as agoraphobia, cannot be cured by philosophical understanding. However, logotherapy has developed a special technique to handle such cases, too. To understand what is going on whenever this technique is used, we take as a starting point a condition which is frequently observed in neurotic individuals, namely, anticipatory anxiety. It is characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid. An individual, for example, who is afraid of blushing when he enters a large room and faces many people will actually be more prone to blush under these circumstances. In this context, one might amend the saying “The wish is father to the thought” to “The fear is mother of the event.” (page 88)\n- excessive intention and hyper attention on pleasure or an end prduct make it impossible to attain the thing \n\n> This was enough to incapacitate the patient for the peak experience of sexual pleasure, since the orgasm was made an object of intention, and an object of attention as well, instead of remaining an unintended effect of unreflected dedication and surrender to the partner. (page 89)  \n\n> Logotherapy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes. (page 89)  \n\n> “The neu- rotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure. (page 90)  \n\n> Paradoxical intention can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness12 results in a hyper- intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, I usually advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the hyper-intention to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep. (page 91)  \n\n> paradoxical intention is effective regardless of the etiological basis of the case concerned. This confirms a statement once made by Edith Weisskopf-Joelson: “Although traditional psychotherapy has insisted that therapeutic practices have to be based on findings on etiology, it is possible that certain factors might cause neuroses during early childhood and that entirely different factors might relieve neuroses during adulthood.”14 (page 92)  \n\n> First of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man’s “nothingbutness,” the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe anyway, namely, that he is the pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free. (page 93)  \n\n> Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment. (page 93)\n- i guess fostering the illusion of free will is the best approach for most patients \n\n> There is nothing conceivable which would so condition a man as to leave him without the slightest freedom. (page 95)\n- this can be used as an extension of stoicism \n\n> An incurably psychotic individual may lose his usefulness but yet retain the dignity of a human being. This is my psychiatric credo. Without it I should not think it worthwhile to be a psychiatrist. For whose sake? Just for the sake of a damaged brain machine which cannot be repaired? If the patient were not definitely more, euthanasia would be justified. (page 95)\n- not sure if this is very moral \n\n> If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke. In no way is it possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself, to laugh. (page 99)\n- similar to happiness \n\n> Today it is not only logotherapists who claim that the feeling of meaninglessness plays an ever increasing role in the etiology of neurosis. As Irvin D. Yalom of Stanford University states in Existential Psychotherapy: “Of forty consecutive patients applying for therapy at a psychiatric outpatient clinic … twelve (30 percent) had some major problem involving meaning (as adjudged from self-ratings, therapists, or independent judges) (page 100)  \n\n> And I could show that this neurosis really originated in a twofold erroneous identification: being jobless was equated with being useless, and being useless was equated with having a meaningless life. (page 100)\n- this gives off one trick pony vibes. like oh its a meaning problem, again. what a surprise \n\n> Therefore, I will not be elaborating here on the meaning of one’s life as a whole, although I do not deny that such a long-range meaning does exist. To invoke an analogy, consider a movie: it consists of thousands upon thousands of individual pictures, and each of them makes sense and carries a meaning, yet the meaning of the whole film cannot be seen before its last sequence is shown. However, we cannot understand the whole film without having first understood each of its components, each of the individual pictures. Isn’t it the same with life?  (page 102)  \n\n> The perception of meaning differs from the classical concept of Gestalt perception insofar as the latter implies the sudden awareness of a “figure” on a “ground,” whereas the perception of meaning, as I see it, more specifically boils down to becoming aware of a possibility against the background of reality or, to express it in plain words, to becoming aware of what can be done about a given situation. (page 103)\n- a gestalt seems to be not unlike that moment during problem solving when you know you hae a solution but you have yet it \"think it out\" (but you know its there) \n\n> And how does a human being go about finding meaning? As Charlotte Bühler has stated: “All we can do is study the lives of people who seem to have found their answers to the questions of what ultimately human life is about as against those who have not.”5 (page 103)  \n\n> meaning is available in spite of—nay, even through—suffering, provided, as noted in Part Two of this book, that the suffering is unavoidable. If it is avoidable, the meaningful thing to do is to remove its cause, for unnecessary suffering is masochistic rather than heroic. If, on the other hand, one cannot change a situation that causes his suffering, he can still choose his attitude. (page 105)  \n\n> Totally explaining one’s crime would be tantamount to explaining away his or her guilt and to seeing in him or her not a free and responsible human being but a machine to be repaired. Even criminals themselves abhor this treatment and prefer to be held responsible for their deeds. (page 105)  \n\n> An American woman once confronted me with the reproach, “How can you still write some of your books in German, Adolf Hitler’s language?” In response, I asked her if she had knives in her kitchen, and when she answered that she did, I acted dismayed and shocked, exclaiming, “How can you still use knives after so many killers have used them to stab and murder their victims?” She stopped objecting to my writing books in German. (page 106)  \n\n> For as soon as we have used an opportunity and have actualized a potential meaning, we have done so once and for all. We have rescued it into the past wherein it has been safely delivered and deposited. In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured. (page 107)  \n\n> It virtually ignores the value of all those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in the sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. (page 108)\n- there IS wisdom in ae beyond things that can be expressed in language. Much knowledge is preverbal \n\n> therapists should see their task in immunizing the trainee against nihilism rather than inoculating him with the cynicism that is a defense mechanism against their own nihilism. (page 108)  \n\n> I argued not only for the rehumanization of psychotherapy but also for what I called “the degurufication of logotherapy.” My interest does not lie in raising parrots that just rehash “their master’s voice,” but rather in passing the torch to “independent and inventive, innovative and creative spirits. (page 109)\n- I like that a lot \n\n> For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best. (page 109)",

Shouldn’t we be concerned with situations where patterns and messages may have been ignored? I have two answers. First, I am not overly worried about the existence of undetected patterns. We have been reading lengthy and complex messages in just about any manifestation of nature that presents jaggedness (such as the palm of a hand, the residues at the bottom of Turkish coffee cups, etc.). Armed with home supercomputers and chained processors, and helped by complexity and “chaos” theories, the scientists, semiscientists, and pseudoscientists will be able to find portents. Second, we need to take into account the costs of mistakes; in my opinion, mistaking the right column for the left one is not as costly as an error in the opposite direction. Even popular opinion warns that bad information is worse than no information at all.\n\nHowever\n\n42\n\nTrading forces someone to think hard; those who merely work hard generally lose their focus and intellectual energy. In addition, they end up drowning in randomness; work ethics, Nero believes, draw people to focus on noise rather than the signal\n\n43\n\nMild success can be explainable by skills and labor.

Imagine that you can replicate a perfect roulette wheel in your attic without having recourse to a carpenter. Computer programs can be written to simulate just about anything. They are even better (and cheaper) than the roulette wheel built by your carpenter, as this physical version may be inclined to favor one number more than others owing to a possible slant in its build or the floor of your attic. These are called the biases.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations are closer to a toy than anything I have seen in my adult life. One can generate thousands, perhaps millions, of random sample paths, and look at the prevalent characteristics of some of their features. The assistance of the computer is instrumental in such studies\n- [[Monte Carlo simulations allow you to simulate just about anything]]\n\n71\n\nMonte Carlo simulation methods were pioneered in martial physics in the Los Alamos laboratory during the A-bomb preparation. They became popular in financial mathematics in the 1980s, particularly in the theories of the random walk of asset prices. Clearly, we have to say that the example of Russian roulette does not need such apparatus, but many problems, particularly those resembling real-life situations, require the potency of a Monte Carlo simulator.\n- [[Resampling Techniques and Computational Statistics#^821989]]\n\n72\n\nIt is a fact that “true” mathematicians do not like Monte Carlo methods. They believe that they rob us of the finesse and elegance of mathematics. They call it “brute force.” For we can replace a large portion of mathematical knowledge with a Monte Carlo simulator (and other computational tricks). For instance, someone with no formal knowledge of geometry can compute the mysterious, almost mystical Pi. How? By drawing a circle inside of a square, and “shooting” random bullets into the picture (as in an arcade), specifying equal probabilities of hitting any point on the map (something called a uniform distribution). The ratio of bullets inside the circle divided by those inside and outside the circle will deliver a multiple of the mystical Pi, with possibly infinite precision. Clearly, this is not an efficient use of a computer as Pi can be computed analytically, that is, in a mathematical form, but the method can give some users more intuition about the subject matter than lines of equations. Some people’s brains and intuitions are oriented in such a way that they are more capable of getting a point in such a manner (I count myself one of those). The computer might not be natural to our human brain; neither is mathematics\n\n76\n\nthe sort of Hegelianism and pseudoscientific historicism leading to such calls as the end of history (it is pseudoscientific because it draws theories from past events without allowing for the fact that such combinations of events might have arisen from randomness; there is no way to verify the claims in a controlled experiment)\n\n78\n\nIn a nutshell we think that we would know when history is made; we believe that people who, say, witnessed the stock market crash of 1929 knew then that they lived an acute historical event and that, should these events repeat themselves, they too would know about such facts. Life for us is made to resemble an adventure movie, as we know ahead of time that something big is about to happen. It is hard to imagine that people who witnessed history did not know at the time how important the moment was. Somehow all respect we may have for history does not translate well into our treatment of the present.\n\n79\n\nA mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point.\n- [[A mistake is not something to be determined after the fact, but in the light of the information until that point]]\n\n80\nergodicity\n\n81\n\nFor an idea to have survived so long across so many cycles is indicative of its relative fitness. Noise, at least some noise, was filtered out. Mathematically, progress means that some new information is better than past information, not that the average of new information will supplant past information, which means that it is optimal for someone, when in doubt, to systematically reject the new idea, information, or method. Clearly and shockingly, always.\n\n82\n\nMiddlebrow inference\n\n88\n\nOver a short time increment, one observes the variability of the portfolio, not the returns. In other words, one sees the variance, little else\n\n88\n\nWhen I see an investor monitoring his portfolio with live prices on his cellular telephone or his handheld, I smile and smile\n\n89\n\nFinally, this explains why people who look too closely at randomness burn out, their emotions drained by the series of pangs they experience. Regardless of what people claim, a negative pang is not offset by a positive one (some psychologists estimate the negative effect for an average loss to be up to 2.5 the magnitude of a positive one); it will lead to an emotional deficit\n\n92\n\nAlan Sokal (the same of the hilarious book a few lines ago),\n\n96\n\nwho do not understand why I cherish the poetry of Baudelaire and Saint-John Perse or obscure (and often impenetrable) writers like Elias Canetti, J.

He had observed that firemen with much downtime who talk to each other for too long come to agree on many things that an outside, impartial observer would find ludicrous (they develop political ideas that are very similar\n\n103\n\nAt a given time in the market, the most successful traders are likely to be those that are best fit to the latest cycle\n\n111\n\nJust as an animal could have survived because its sample path was lucky, the “best” operators in a given business can come from a subset of operators who survived because of overfitness to a sample path—a sample path that was free of the evolutionary rare event. One vicious attribute is that the longer these animals can go without encountering the rare event, the more vulnerable they will be to it\n\n111\n\nBy some viciousness of the structure of randomness, a profitable person like John, someone who is a pure loser in the long run and correspondingly unfit for survival, presents a high degree of eligibility in the short run and has the propensity to multiply his genes.\n\n113\n\nWhy do they confuse probability and expectation, that is, probability and probability times the payoff? Mainly because much of people’s schooling comes from examples in symmetric environments, like a coin toss, where such a difference does not matter. In fact, the so-called bell curve that seems to have found universal use in society is entirely symmetric\n\n115\n\nA and B in the preceding example, my opinion was that the market was more likely to go up (“I would be bullish”), but that it was preferable to short it (“I would be bearish”), because, in the event of its going down, it could go down a lot.\n\n118\n\nA professor who computes the average of his students’ grades removes the highest and lowest observations, which he would call outliers, and takes the average of the remaining ones, without this being an unsound practice. A casual weather forecaster does the same with extreme temperatures—an unusual occurrence might be deemed to skew the overall result (though we will see that this may turn out to be a mistake when it comes to forecasting future properties of the ice cap). So people in finance borrow the technique and ignore infrequent events, not noticing that the effect of a rare event can bankrupt a company\n\n121\n\nThe problem is that we read too much into shallow recent history, with statements like “this has never happened before,” but not from history in general (things that never happened before in one area tend eventually to happen). In other words, history teaches us that things that never happened before do happen. It can teach us a lot outside of the narrowly defined time series; the broader the look, the better the lesson.\n\n127\n\nepistemologists operating in the applied sciences are often called methodologists or philosophers of science\n\n132\n\nOne cannot infer much from a single experiment in a random environment—an experiment needs a repeatability showing some causal component.\n\n135\n\nWhy is a theory never right?

If it poses a threat, then I will not. I want to take the best of what the past can give me without its dangers. Accordingly, I will use statistics and inductive methods to make aggressive bets, but I will not use them to manage my risks and exposure. Surprisingly, all the surviving traders I know seem to have done the same. They trade on ideas based on some observation (that includes past history) but, like the Popperian scientists, they make sure that the costs of being wrong are limited (and their probability is not derived from past data). Unlike Carlos and John, they know before getting involved in the trading strategy which events would prove their conjecture wrong and allow for it (recall that Carlos and John used past history both to make their bets and to measure their risk). They would then terminate their trade. This is called a stop loss, a predetermined exit point, a protection from the black swan. I find it rarely practiced.\n\n140\n\nlikelihood\n\n*diff between likelihood and probability*\n\n142\n\nThere are other aspects to the monkeys problem; in real life the other monkeys are not countable, let alone visible\n\n*survivorship bias is same as publication bias*\n\n145\n\nAside from the misperception of one’s performance, there is a social treadmill effect: You get rich, move to rich neighborhoods, then become poor again. To that add the psychological treadmill effect; you get used to wealth and revert to a set point of satisfaction. This problem of some people never really getting to feel satisfied by wealth (beyond a given point) has been the subject of technical discussions on happiness.\n\n147\n\nSomething about the praise lavished upon him for living in austerity while being so rich escapes me; if austerity is the end, he should become a monk or a social worker—we should remember that becoming rich is a purely selfish act, not a social one\n\n152\n\nI will probably lecture him that Machiavelli ascribed to luck at least a 50% role in life (the rest was cunning and bravura), and that was before the creation of modern markets\n\n152\n\nThe concept presented here is well-known for some of its variations under the names survivorship bias, data mining, data snooping, over-fitting, regression to the mean, etc., basically situations where the performance is exaggerated by the observer, owing to a misperception of the importance of randomness.\n\n154\n\nprovided by his parents; we would be supplied with black-and-white pictures in the middle of the book of a great mind in the making. And the following year, should he stop outperforming (recall that his odds of having a good year have stayed at 50%) they would start laying blame, finding fault with the relaxation in his work ethics, or his dissipated lifestyle. They will find something he did before when he was successful that he has subsequently stopped doing, and attribute his failure to that. The truth will be, however, that he simply ran out of luck.\n\n154\n\nThe first counterintuitive point is that a population entirely composed of bad managers will produce a small amount of great track records. As a matter of fact, assuming the manager shows up unsolicited at your door, it will be practically impossible to figure out whether he is good or bad. The results would not markedly change even if the population were composed entirely of managers who are expected in the long run to lose money. Why? Because owing to volatility, some of them will make money. We can see here that volatility actually helps bad investment decisions\n\n155\n\nI will get to see only the best of the managers, not all of the managers\n\n*perhaps the spread in human talent is smaller than expected based on the output we see bc much of that output can be attributed to luck.*\n\n156\n\nThis “reversion” for the large outliers is what has been observed in history and explained as regression to the mean. Note that the larger the deviation, the more important its effect\n\n156\n\nIn addition, this example illustrates the properties of ergodicity, namely, that time will eliminate the annoying effects of randomness\n\n*take away for ergodicity seems not to overplay your hand. rather know when your run is over then hede the money.*\n\n157\n\nRecall that the survivorship bias depends on the size of the initial population. The information that a person derived some profits in the past, just by itself, is neither meaningful nor relevant. We need to know the size of the population from which he came.\n\n162\n\nBeset with insomnia, the computderized day traders become night testers plowing the data for some of its properties. By dint of throwing their monkeys on typewriters, without specifying what book they want their monkey to write, they will hit upon hypothetical gold somewhere. Many of them blindly believe in it\n\n*you must have good theory otherwise you are just randoml lookin for associations. you are likely to find many, all random coincidences.*\n\n164\n\nWhile we are certainly fooled by randomness when it comes to a single times series, the foolishness is compounded when it comes to the comparison between, say, two people, or a person and a benchmark. Why? Because both are random.\n\n166\n\nPhilosophers of statistics call this the reference case problem to explain that there is no true attainable randomness in practice, only in theory.\n\n167\n\nEven the fathers of statistical science forgot that a random series of runs need not exhibit a pattern to look random; as a matter of fact, data that is perfectly patternless would be extremely suspicious and appear to be man-made.\n\n168\n\nThe problem is that a finding of absence and an absence of findings get mixed together. There may be great information in the fact that nothing took place. As Sherlock Holmes noted in the Silver Blaze case—the curious thing was that the dog did not bark.\n\n168\n\nThere are professions in randomness for which performance is low in luck, like casinos, which manage to tame randomness\n\n172\n\nFor instance, Brian Arthur, an economist concerned with nonlinearities at the Santa Fe Institute, wrote that chance events coupled with positive feedback rather than technological superiority will determine economic superiority—not some abstrusely defined edge in a given area of expertise\n\n*path dependencies. fascinating: chance events + network externalities*\n\n173\n\nThe Polya process can be presented as follows: Assume an urn initially containing equal quantities of black and red balls. You are to guess each time which color you will pull out before you make the draw. Here the game is rigged. Unlike a conventional urn, the probability of guessing correctly depends on past success, as you get better or worse at guessing depending on past performance. Thus, the probability of winning increases after past wins, that of losing increases after past losses. Simulating such a process, one can see a huge variance of outcomes, with astonishing successes and a large number of failures (what we called skewness).\n\n*th message i think remains as: capitalize on chance events and hedge against black swans.*\n\n173\n\nSay you played roulette and won. Would this increase your chances of winning again? No. In a Polya process case, it does. Why is this so mathematically hard to work with? Because the notion of independence (i.e., when the next draw does not depend on past outcomes) is violated. Independence is a requirement for working with the (known) math of probability\n\n183\n\nIt is worth stopping, at this juncture, and discussing the distinction between normative and positive sciences. A normative science (clearly a self-contradictory concept) offers prescriptive teachings; it studies how things should be. Some economists, for example those of the efficient-market religion, believe that our studies should be based on the hypothesis that humans are rational and act rationally because it is the best thing for them to do (it is mathematically “optimal”). The opposite is a positive science, which is based on how people actually are observed to behave. In spite of economists’ envy of physicists, physics is an inherently positive science while economics, particularly microeconomics and financial economics, is predominantly a normative one. Normative economics is like religion without the aesthetics.\n\n186\n\nPsychologists call this effect of comparing to a given reference anchoring.\n\n187\n\nThis morning I did my bit of anecdotal empiricism and asked the hotel concierge how long it takes to go to the airport. “40 minutes?” I asked. “About 35,” he answered. Then I asked the lady at the reception if the journey was 20 minutes. “No, about 25,” she answered. I timed the trip: 31 minutes.\n\n191\n\nProust wrote frequently about the surprise people have when coming across emotions in Homeric heroes that are similar to those we experience today. By genetic standards, these Homeric heroes of thirty centuries ago in all likelihood have the exact identical makeup as the pudgy middle-aged man you see schlepping groceries in the parking lot.\n\n192\n\nPopular belief holds that the religious backdrop of the first and second millennia blocked the growth of tools that hint at absence of determinism, and caused the delays in probability research. The idea is extremely dubious; we simply did not compute probabilities because we did not dare to? Surely the reason is rather because we did not need to. Much of our problem comes from the fact that we have evolved out of such a habitat faster, much faster, than our genes. Even worse, our genes have not changed at all\n\n192\n\nThose heuristics that we said were “quick and dirty” to the psychologists are “fast and frugal” to the evolutionary psychologists. Not only that, but some thinkers, like the cognitive scientist Gerd Gigerenzer, seem to have obsessively taken the other side of the trade from Kahneman and Tversky; his work and that of his associates at the ABC Group (Adaptive Behavior and Cognition) intend to show that we are rational and that evolution produces a form of rationality he calls “ecological rationality.” They believe that not only are we hard-wired for optimizing probabilistic behavior in situations like mate selection (how many people of the opposite sex do you need to meet before pulling the trigger?), or choosing a meal, but we are also so wired for stock selection and that we do it appropriately if the stocks are presented to us in the correct manner\n\n194\n\nI will present the theses of two watershed works presented in readable books, Damasio’s Descartes’ Error and LeDoux’s Emotional Brain.\n\nDescartes’ Error presents a very simple thesis: You perform a surgical ablation on a piece of someone’s brain (say, to remove a tumor and tissue around it) with the sole resulting effect of an inability to register emotions, nothing else (the IQ and every other faculty remain the same). What you have done is a controlled experiment to separate someone’s intelligence from his emotions. Now you have a purely rational human being unencumbered with feelings and emotions. Let’s watch: Damasio reported that the purely unemotional man was incapable of making the simplest decision. He could not get out of bed in the morning, and frittered away his days fruitlessly weighing decisions. Shock! This flies in the face of everything one would have expected: One cannot make a decision without emotion. Now, mathematics gives the same answer: If one were to perform an optimizing operation across a large collection of variables, even with a brain as large as ours, it would take a very long time to decide on the simplest of tasks. So we need a shortcut; emotions are there to prevent us from temporizing. Does it remind you of Herbert Simon’s idea? It seems that the emotions are the ones doing the job. Psychologists call them “lubricants of reason.”\n\nJoseph LeDoux’s theory about the role of emotions in behavior is even more potent: Emotions affect one’s thinking. He figured out that much of the connections from the emotional systems to the cognitive systems are stronger than connections from the cognitive systems to the emotional systems. The implication is that we feel emotions (limbic brain) then find an explanation (neocortex). As we saw with Claparède’s discovery, much of the opinions and assessments that we have concerning risks may be the simple result of emotions.",
